Therefore, the number of pairs with a < b is equal to the number of possible a such that a < 20!a^{-1}, which simplifies to a^2 < 20! or a < sqrt(20!). Therefore, the number of such a is half the total number of divisors, adjusted for square factors.

Wait, but a and b have exponents for the primes? Wait no, in the problem statement, the numerator and denominator (a and b) when written in lowest terms.

But which cannot happen because, for instance, prime number p_0 (which appears once in N! for primes N/2 < p_0 <=N). For example, primes between N/2 and N cannot come in pairs. So hence exponents for primes bigger than N/2 will be 1. Therefore, odd. Hence sqrt(N!) is not integer. Hence N! is not a square. Therefore, the number of divisors N! So, accordingly, the number of such co-prime pairs is 2^{k} with k primes, leading to 2^k ordered pairs. Thus, the number of unordered pairs, accounting for swapping a and b, is 2^{k-1}. So for N =6, with three primes, 2^(3 -1)=4, which matches what we saw for 720.\n",

The question is a bit more precise: it says that the original rational number between 0 and 1 is written in reduced form, and you multiply numerator and denominator (from reduced form), and that product is equal to 20!. <keep>So that equivalent to saying find all reduced fractions a/b where 0 < a/b <1 and a*b=20!. Hence, equivalent to coprime pairs (a,b) with a*b=20! and a < b.</keep>\n",

      "Thus previous logic applies; each such pair is obtained by assignment of primes to a or b, since a and b need to be coprime. Assign each prime of 20! to either a or b. So 8 primes in 20! Each has two choices. Hence no. of pairs (a,b), ordered is 2^8=256. Since none of the ordered have pairs a=b, each unordered pair is counted as (a,b) and (b,a). The number with a < b is half of the total pairs, so 256/2 =128. Hence 128 such numbers. Therefore, The answer is 128, corresponding to \\boxed{128}?  Or wait, wait prime factors of 20!

For each prime p | N, assign all the exponents in p to a or to b, but not both, since a and b must be coprime.\n",
