Okay, let me go through this step by step. The problem is to find the sum of all entries of the matrix sum M + M² + M³ + ... + M²⁰⁰⁹ where ω is a nonreal root of x³ = 1. 

First, since ω is a primitive cube root of unity, we know that 1 + ω + ω² = 0 and ω³ = 1. These properties will be useful later.

The matrix M is given as:
\[
\mathbf{M} = \begin{pmatrix} -\omega^2 & - \omega \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}
\]

I need to compute powers of M to find a pattern. Let's start with M²:
\[
\mathbf{M}^2 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -\omega^2 & -\omega \end{pmatrix}
\]

Then, M³ turns out to be the identity matrix:
\[
\mathbf{M}^3 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Since M³ is the identity matrix, the powers of M repeat every 3 steps. Therefore, M⁴ = M, M⁵ = M², M⁶ = I, and so on. 

The total number of terms from M¹ to M²⁰⁰⁹ is 2009. Dividing by 3, we get 669 full cycles (each cycle being M + M² + I) and a remainder of 2 terms (M²⁰⁰⁸ and M²⁰⁰⁹, which are M and M² respectively because 2008 ≡ 1 mod 3 and 2009 ≡ 2 mod 3).

Thus, the sum S can be expressed as:
\[
S = 669(\mathbf{M} + \mathbf{M}^2 + \mathbf{I}) + \mathbf{M} + \mathbf{M}^2
\]

Next, we need to compute the sum of all entries of this matrix. Calculating each component:
- The sum of entries in M + M² + I per cycle is 6 (as derived using properties of ω).
- The remaining terms M and M² each contribute a sum of 2 (using similar simplifications).

Adding these contributions:
\[
669 \times 6 + 2 \times 2 = 4014 + 4 = 4018
\]

Thus, the sum of all entries is \boxed{4018}.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 1: <keep>And ω is a nonreal root of x3 = 1. So first, let me recall that the roots of x3 = 1 are 1, ω, and ω2, where ω and ω2 are complex (primitive cube roots of unity). So ω satisfies ω3 = 1 and ω ≠ 1. Also, we know that 1 + ω + ω2 = 0, since the sum of roots of x3 - 1 = 0 is zero (since the coefficient of x2 is zero).</keep>

- Paragraph 7, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, the powers of M cycle every 3.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 2: <keep>Number of cycles: 2009 divided by 3 gives 669 full cycles (since 3*669 = 2007) and a remainder of 2 terms. So total sum is 669*(M + M2 + M3) + M2008 + M2009.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 3: <keep>Therefore, the total sum S is 669*(M + M2 + I) + M + M2 = (669 +1)*(M + M2) + 669*I = 670*(M + M2) + 669*I.</keep>
