Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we need to find the number of ordered triples (a, b, c) where a, b, and c are positive integers. The conditions are that a is a factor of both b and c, and the sum a + b + c equals 100. Hmm, okay. Let's unpack that step by step.

First, since a is a factor of b and c, that means b and c are multiples of a. So, we can express b and c in terms of a and some other integers. Let's denote b = a * k and c = a * m, where k and m are positive integers. That makes sense because if a divides b and c, then b and c must be integer multiples of a.

So, substituting these into the equation a + b + c = 100, we get:

a + a*k + a*m = 100

We can factor out the a:

a*(1 + k + m) = 100

Now, since a is a positive integer, and 1 + k + m is also a positive integer, this means that a must be a divisor of 100. So, possible values of a are the divisors of 100. Let me list the divisors of 100 first.

The divisors of 100 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100. Let's confirm that. 100 divided by 1 is 100, 2 is 50, 4 is 25, 5 is 20, 10 is 10, and then the reverse: 20 is 5, 25 is 4, 50 is 2, 100 is 1. So yes, those are the positive divisors.

So a can be any of these divisors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100. For each possible a, we can find the possible values of k and m such that the equation holds.

Since we have a*(1 + k + m) = 100, for each a, the term (1 + k + m) must equal 100/a. Let's denote t = 100/a. So, 1 + k + m = t. Hence, k + m = t - 1.

But k and m are positive integers, so k ≥ 1 and m ≥ 1. The number of solutions to k + m = t - 1 in positive integers is (t - 2) choose (1), right? Because if k and m are positive integers, then the number of solutions is (t - 1 - 1) = t - 2. Wait, hold on. Wait, that might not be accurate.

Actually, for the equation x + y = N where x and y are positive integers, the number of solutions is N - 1. For example, if N = 5, the solutions are (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1), which is 4 solutions, which is 5 - 1. So yes, general formula is (N - 1) solutions. Hence, in our case, k and m are positive integers, and their sum is (t - 1) - 1? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, let's recast that. The equation is k + m = t - 1, where t is 100/a. But since k and m must be at least 1, the number of solutions is (t - 1 - 1) choose 1? No, wait, if the equation is k + m = S with k and m positive integers, then the number of solutions is (S - 1) choose (1). Because the formula is S - 1. For example, S=2: (1,1), which is 1 solution, which is 2-1=1. So, for k + m = S, the number of solutions is S-1.

Wait, but in our case, k and m must be positive integers. So, if the equation is k + m = T, the number of positive integer solutions is (T - 1). So, here, k + m = t - 1 - 1? Wait, let me clarify:

Wait, original equation after substitution is 1 + k + m = 100/a. Then subtract 1: k + m = 100/a - 1. So, the equation k + m = (100/a) - 1. So, for each a, if we define T = (100/a) - 1, then the number of positive integer solutions (k, m) is T - 1? Wait, no.

No, if we have k and m as positive integers, the number of solutions to k + m = N is N - 1. Let's verify. Suppose N=2. Then k and m can be (1,1). That's 1 solution, which is 2-1=1. If N=3, then (1,2) and (2,1), that's 2 solutions, which is 3-1=2. So yes, that holds.

Wait, but in our case, T is (100/a) - 1. So, k + m = T = (100/a) - 1. Therefore, the number of solutions is T - 1 = (100/a - 1) - 1 = 100/a - 2. But this can't be negative. So, we have to ensure that T = (100/a - 1) is at least 2, so that T - 1 is at least 1. Wait, if T is 2, then T - 1 is 1, so it can be. Let me really make sure here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to note that if k and m are positive integers, the number of solutions (k, m) for k + m = S is S - 1. So here, S has to be at least 2. If S=1, there would be no solutions because k and m are positive integers.

Therefore, for the equation k + m = T where T must be an integer because both k and m are integers. So T must also be a positive integer. Moreover, T ≥ 2 to have at least one solution. Wait, since k and m are positive integers, then even if T is 1, which would not have any solutions, but in our case, as 100/a -1 must be an integer?

Wait, 100/a must be integer, since t = 100/a, and since a is a divisor of 100. Therefore, yes, 100/a is integer, so 100/a -1 is also integer, but we need 100/a -1 = T must be at least 2, otherwise, there's no solutions. So T ≥ 2. So 100/a - 1 >= 2 => 100/a >= 3 => a <= 100/3 ≈ 33.333...

But since a is a divisor of 100, the possible a's are those divisors where a <= 33.333... Therefore, the divisors of 100 greater than 100/3 ≈ 33.333 are 25, 50, 100. Wait, 25 is 25, which is less than 33.333, 50 is 50, which is greater than 33.333, 100 is 100, which is way larger. Wait, but T = 100/a -1.

So 50 is a divisor of 100. Then T = 100/50 -1 = 2 -1 = 1. So 100/a -1=1, meaning S=1, so k +m=1, which has no solutions since k,m>=1.

Similarly for a=100, 100/100=1, T=1 -1=0, so k +m=0, which has no solutions. Hence for a=50 and a=100, there would be zero solutions. Thus, those a's (50, 100) would not yield any triples. For a=25, let's check: T=100/25 -1=4 -1=3. So k +m=3, which has (1,2),(2,1)=2 solutions. So number of solutions is 2.

Wait, so for each a where T = (100/a -1)>=2, we get the number of solutions (k,m). Wait, maybe I need to verify for each divisor.

Let's list all divisors of 100 again:

1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100.

For each a:

Case 1: a=1

Then T =100/1 -1=99. So k + m=99, which has 98 solutions (k=1 to 98, m=98 to 1). So number of solutions here is 98.

Case 2: a=2

T=100/2 -1=50-1=49. So k +m=49. Solutions: 48.

Case 3: a=4

T=100/4 -1=25 -1=24. Solutions: 23.

Case 4: a=5

T=20 -1=19. Solutions: 18.

Case 5: a=10

T=10 -1=9. Solutions:8.

Case 6: a=20

T=5 -1=4. Solutions:3.

Case7: a=25

T=4 -1=3. Solutions:2.

Case8:a=50

T=2 -1=1. Solutions:0.

Case9:a=100

T=1 -1=0. Solutions:0.

Therefore, adding up the number of solutions for each a:

a=1:98

a=2:48

a=4:23

a=5:18

a=10:8

a=20:3

a=25:2

a=50:0

a=100:0

So total number of triples is 98+48+23+18+8+3+2= Let's compute:

First, 98+48=146

146+23=169

169+18=187

187+8=195

195+3=198

198+2=200

So total 200.

Therefore, the number of ordered triples is 200. So, the answer should be \boxed{200}.

But let me check once more to ensure that I didn't make any calculation errors.

Starting again:

For each divisor a of 100:

a | 100, so possible a's:1,2,4,5,10,20,25,50,100.

Compute T = 100/a -1.

For each a:

a=1:

T=100/1 -1=99. k+m=99 has 98 positive integer solutions. Correct.

a=2:

T=50 -1=49. So k +m=49. Solutions=48. Correct.

a=4:

T=25 -1=24. Solutions=23. Correct.

a=5:

T=20 -1=19. Solutions=18. Correct.

a=10:

T=10 -1=9. Solutions=8. Correct.

a=20:

T=5 -1=4. Solutions=3. Correct.

a=25:

T=4 -1=3. Solutions=2. Correct.

a=50:

T=2 -1=1. Solutions=0. Correct.

a=100:

T=1 -1=0. Solutions=0. Correct.

Total sum:98+48=146; 146+23=169; 169+18=187; 187+8=195; 195+3=198; 198+2=200. Yes, 200. So that seems right.

Alternatively, just to think about, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using generating functions? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, the problem can be phrased in terms of a, b, c with a | b and a |c, positive integers, and a + b + c =100.

Since a divides b and c, set b = a * k, c = a * m. Therefore, a*(1 +k +m)=100, so 1 +k +m = 100/a. So k and m are positive integers, hence for each divisor a of 100, the number of pairs (k,m) is the number of positive integer solutions to k + m = (100/a -1). If (100/a -1) >= 2, the number of solutions is (100/a -2). Wait, but according to our previous calculation, seems it's (100/a -1 -1) =100/a -2. Wait, not exactly, but let me check again.

We have equation k + m = N, where N = (100/a -1). K and m are positive integers, so the number of solutions is N -1, but only if N >=2.

Wait, No. If k and m are positive integers, k + m = N. The number of solutions is (N-1 choose 1)= N -1.

But this is when we have N >=2.

If N=1, then k + m=1 with k and m positive integers is impossible. Similarly, N=0, negative, etc.

So in our case, N=100/a -1. If 100/a -1 >= 2, then we have 100/a -1 -1=100/a -2 ? Wait no. Wait, the number of solutions is (N-1) when N is the sum. So if N=3, solutions: (1,2),(2,1)=2 which equals N-1=2. So indeed the formula is (N -1) solutions.

But in our problem, N=100/a -1. So the number of solutions is ((100/a -1) -1)=100/a -2. So is that correct?

Wait, no. Wait the number of solutions is (N -1) where N=k+m. So in our case, N=100/a -1. So number of solutions is (N -1)= (100/a -1) -1=100/a -2. Wait, no, why did I subtract 1 again?

No, wait the number of solutions is (N -1). Let's take N = t= k + m. So, if N=100/a -1, then solutions= (N -1). Wait that is, solutions= (100/a -1 -1)=100/a -2. So, 100/a -2 solutions? Is that accurate?

But in our prior calculation for a=25, t=4-1=3, k +m = N=3. Number solutions=2, which is 3-1=2. So here, according to the formula solutions= N-1, which is indeed (100/a -1)-1=100/a -2. So in that a=25 case, 100/a=4, so 4-2=2. Correct. Similarly, when a=1, T=99, solutions=99-1=98. So 98=100/1 -2=98. So that aligns. So in general, for a divisor a of 100, the number of solutions is (100/a -2) as long as (100/a -1)>=2, which implies 100/a >=3, so a<=33.333.

But when 100/a -1=1 (i.e., 100/a =2 → a=50), then number of solutions=1-1=0. Which is also handled by the formula 100/a -2=50-2=48. Wait, no. Wait.

Wait for a=50, 100/a=2. So 100/a -2=0. Which matches that there are no solutions. Similarly for a=100, 100/a -2=1-2=-1, which is invalid. However in those cases, we just take the number of solutions as 0. Therefore, actually, the general formula would be max(0, 100/a -2).

But since 100/a must be integer, given that a is a divisor of 100.

Thus, when a is a divisor of 100, 100/a is an integer, say, d.

Then d=100/a. So the equation turns into a + a*k + a*m=100 → a(1+ k +m)=100 →1 +k +m= d.

Hence, k +m= d-1.

But for each d >= 2 (since k and m are at least 1, so k +m = d-1 >= 2 → d-1>=2 → d>=3.

No, wait. Wait a=100: d=1. So d=1: k +m=0, which is impossible.

If a=50: d=2: k +m=1, but no solutions since k,m>=1.

a=25: d=4: k+m=4-1=3: solutions=2.

So for all divisors a where d >=2 (i.e., a <=50), but really, since a can be up to 100. But I have that:

If d=100/a: when does k+m = d-1 has solutions.

k and m are positive integers, so d-1 >=2, so d >=3. So if d >=3, then the number of solutions is d-2.

So therefore, the number of solutions is (d - 2) where d=100/a.

Therefore, the number of triples for a given a is (d -2) where d=100/a. But only when d >=3, otherwise it's 0.

But since a is a divisor of 100, d=100/a is also a divisor of 100. So list of possible d:

For a=1, d=100:1

Wait a=1: d=100/a=100, since 100/1=100. But then k + m=100 -1=99. So solutions= 98.

But using the formula: d=100/a=100: 100 -2=98 solutions. Correct.

But the formula is really d=100/a, then (d -2) if d >=3. Otherwise, 0. So, checking each a:

For a=1: d=100 → 100-2=98

a=2: d=50→50-2=48

a=4:25→25-2=23

a=5:20→20-2=18

a=10:10→10-2=8

a=20:5→5-2=3

a=25:4→4-2=2

a=50:2→2-2=0, same as before

a=100:1→1-2=-1→0.

Therefore, all right, this way, a=50 and a=100 give zero, and others give positive as above.

Therefore, as above, total is 200. It seems correct. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{200}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{200}
