Okay, so the user wants me to identify which parts of the existing reasoning are essential to keep for future steps. Let me read through the problem and the thinking trajectory again to understand what's crucial.

The problem is about finding ordered triples (a, b, c) where a is a factor of both b and c, and their sum is 100. The reasoning starts by expressing b and c as multiples of a, leading to the equation a(1 + k + m) = 100. Then, it's determined that a must be a divisor of 100, so the divisors are listed. For each divisor a, the number of pairs (k, m) is calculated based on the equation k + m = (100/a - 1), which gives the number of positive integer solutions.

Looking through the steps, the key parts are:

1. Expressing b and c as a*k and a*m. This is fundamental because it transforms the problem into finding k and m, which simplifies the equation.
2. The equation a(1 + k + m) = 100 derived from substituting these into the original sum. This equation is central to all further steps.
3. Listing the divisors of 100. This sets the possible values of a, which drives the rest of the calculation.
4. For each divisor a, calculating the number of (k, m) pairs. The formula here (number of solutions = 100/a - 2) and the check for valid solutions (d >=3) are crucial to get the count right.
5. The tabulation of each a's contribution and summing them up to get the total of 200. This shows the final computation steps that lead to the answer.

Each of these steps relies on specific information. The substitution step is necessary to understand how the problem is transformed. The list of divisors is needed to iterate through possible a values. The formula for the number of solutions (which uses 100/a -2) must be retained because it's applied for each divisor. The final summation of all valid cases gives the total, so that part's essential.

I need to make sure that the kept sections include the substitution of variables, the divisors list, the formula for solutions, and the summation. Missing any of these could lead to losing track of how the answer was derived. But also, I shouldn't mark too muchâ€”just the critical lines where the core equations and logic are established.
