Alright, let's tackle this problem. We need to find the minimum and maximum values of the expression \((x_1 + 3x_2 + 5x_3)(x_1 + \frac{x_2}{3} + \frac{x_3}{5})\) given that \(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 1\) and all variables are non-negative.

First, I'll define \(A = x_1 + 3x_2 + 5x_3\) and \(B = x_1 + \frac{x_2}{3} + \frac{x_3}{5}\). The product \(AB\) needs to be optimized. Expanding \(AB\) gives a quadratic expression, but maybe substituting \(x_3 = 1 - x_1 - x_2\) could simplify things. 

After substitution, \(A = 5 - 4x_1 - 2x_2\) and \(B = \frac{4x_1}{5} + \frac{2x_2}{15} + \frac{1}{5}\). The product \(AB\) becomes a function of \(x_1\) and \(x_2\), which might be optimized using calculus or by checking boundary values. 

Using Lagrange multipliers leads to contradictions, suggesting extrema might be at boundaries. Checking the vertices \((1,0,0)\), \((0,1,0)\), and \((0,0,1)\) all yield \(AB = 1\). 

Next, expanding \(AB\) as a quadratic form and using the constraint \(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 1\), we find \(AB = 1 + \text{positive terms}\), implying the minimum is indeed 1. 

For the maximum, analyzing boundaries by setting variables to zero and using substitutions identifies the maximum at \((x_1, x_2, x_3) = (\frac{1}{2}, 0, \frac{1}{2})\), yielding \(AB = \frac{9}{5}\).

Verification via test points confirms that values between vertices yield higher results but none exceed \(\frac{9}{5}\). Thus, the final answers are the minimum \(1\) and maximum \(\frac{9}{5}\).

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 1: <keep>First, let's understand the expression. It's the product of two linear expressions. Let me denote the first term as \(A = x_1 + 3x_2 + 5x_3\) and the second term as \(B = x_1 + \frac{x_2}{3} + \frac{x_3}{5}\). So we need to find the minimum and maximum of \(A \times B\).</keep>

- Paragraph 4, Sentence 1: <keep>Setting up Lagrangian:</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 15: <keep>So now we have three equations:</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 22: <keep>Therefore, the extrema may be achieved at the vertices of the simplex defined by \(x_1 +x_2 +x_3=1\), \(x_i \geq0\).</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 1: <keep>Checking the values at the vertices. The vertices occur when two variables are zero, and the third is 1.</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 9: <keep>Interesting! All vertices give \(AB=1\). So maybe the function is constant 1 on the vertices, but maybe higher or lower in between?</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 4: <keep>Replacing \(u^2 +v^2 +w^2\) in AB:</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 13: <keep>Hence, the minimum value is 1, achieved when all cross terms are zero, i.e., when at most one variable is non-zero.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 1: <keep>To maximize AB, we need to maximize \(\frac{4}{3}uv + \frac{16}{5}uw + \frac{4}{15}vw\).</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 6: <keep>This is a quadratic function in \(u\) and \(v\).</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 11: <keep>Solving the system of equations leads to contradictions, indicating no interior maxima.</keep>

- Paragraph 8, Sentence 10: <keep>Case3: \(u +v =1\).</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 20: <keep>Hence, among all boundaries, the maximum of \(f(u, v)\) is 0.8 when \(v=0\) and \(u=1/2\).</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 1: <keep>Compute AB at \(x_1=1/2\), \(x_2=0\), \(x_3=1/2\): \(AB = 9/5\).</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 6: <keep>Conclusion: min \(AB=1\), achieved at vertices; max \(AB=9/5\), achieved at \((1/2,0,1/2)\).</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 1: <keep>Verification via test points confirms maximum at \(9/5\).</keep>

**Final Answer**
The minimum value is \(\boxed{1}\) and the maximum value is \(\boxed{\dfrac{9}{5}}\).
