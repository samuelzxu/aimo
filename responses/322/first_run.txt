Okay, let's break down how I approached this problem. The question is about whether there's a convex polyhedron with two ants' routes such that only one face has distinct numbers of edges used by each ant, while all other faces have the same numbers. 

First, I considered the requirements: both ants must form closed loops without repeating vertices, and each face must have two numbers representing edges from each ant. The challenge is to have only one face where these numbers differ. 

I started by thinking about simple polyhedrons like cubes and prisms. For example, if two ants use different cycles on a cube, how would their edge counts distribute across faces? Initially, I explored Hamiltonian cycles and face-based cycles but realized they led to multiple faces with distinct counts. 

Then, I considered the concept of symmetric difference between cycles. If two cycles differ by exactly the edges of one face, then that face would have distinct counts while others would have equal counts. This idea comes from graph theory, where the symmetric difference of two cycles can form another cycle, potentially a single face's boundary.

For instance, in a cube, if one cycle (C1) includes edges of the front face and another cycle (C2) is modified by removing those edges and adding others around the cube, the symmetric difference would be the front face's edges. This would mean all other faces have edges either used by both cycles or none, resulting in equal counts. Only the front face, where edges are exclusively in one cycle, would have different counts. 

After verifying that such cycles can exist in polyhedrons like cubes and applying graph theory concepts, I concluded that constructing such routes is possible, hence the answer is "Yes."

- Paragraph 3, Sentence 3: <keep>Hmm. So each face has two numbers written: first ant's edges and second ant's edges.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 4: <keep>The question is whether there's a polyhedron and pair of routes such that exactly one face has these two numbers not equal, and all other faces have these two numbers equal.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 1: <keep>So, in order for only one face to have a pair of distinct numbers, all other faces would need to have, for each face, the same count for both ants.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 1: <keep>But if cycles use certain edges, the counts on the faces would be related.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 2: <keep>Alternatively, think in terms of parity.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 1: <keep>When a cycle is drawn on a polyhedron, each time it crosses a face, it must enter and exit, so maybe the number of edges on a face is even?</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 1: <keep>If in all except one face, counts a_i = b_i, then it's possible that for each edge not on the exceptional face, if the first ant uses it, the second ant must also use it.</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentence 1: <keep>Edges on the exceptional face: Letâ€™s say the exceptional face is F.</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentence 3: <keep>For F', a = b. So if the edge e is used by any ant, then F' would have a or b increased by 1.</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentence 4: <keep>Since F' must have a = b, then if the first ant uses e, the second ant must also use e.</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, every edge of F must be adjacent to a non-exceptional face.</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 2: <keep>Therefore, if any edge of F is used by either ant, it must be used by both.</keep>
- Paragraph 14, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, the conclusion is that for all edges in the polyhedron, if an edge is used by an ant, then it's either on the exceptional face or adjacent to non-exceptional faces, but as shown before, edges adjacent to non-exceptional faces must be used by both or none, so the only edges where the ants can differ are the edges on the exceptional face.</keep>
- Paragraph 18, Sentence 1: <keep>If cycles use certain edges, the counts on the faces would be related.</keep>
- Paragraph 21, Sentence 1: <keep>In graph terms, symmetric difference of two cycles is a collection of cycles.</keep>
- Paragraph 21, Sentence 2: <keep>To have symmetric difference being a single face (i.e., the edges bounding a face), use that.</keep>
- Paragraph 21, Sentence 3: <keep>Therefore, on all other faces, each edge is used by both cycles or both cycles do not use it.</keep>
- Paragraph 22, Sentence 1: <keep>From graph theory, the symmetric difference of two cycles corresponds to the sum (in GF(2)) of their edge sets.</keep>
- Paragraph 22, Sentence 2: <keep>Such an approach is used in homological algebra over GF(2).</keep>
- Paragraph 23, Sentence 1: <keep>In planar graphs, each face boundary is a cycle, and cycles generate the cycle space.</keep>
- Paragraph 23, Sentence 2: <keep>Therefore, the boundary operator maps edges to vertices (with addition modulo 2).</keep>
- Paragraph 24, Sentence 1: <keep>For example, take any convex polyhedron where the boundary of a single face can be expressed as the symmetric difference of two cycles.</keep>
- Paragraph 24, Sentence 2: <keep>Such polyhedrons include the cube.</keep>
- Paragraph 25, Sentence 1: <keep>If cycles C1 and C2 are such that their symmetric difference is front face.</keep>
- Paragraph 25, Sentence 2: <keep>For edges not on front face, if an edge is in C1, it's in C2.</keep>
- Paragraph 25, Sentence 3: <keep>Hence, their counts on other faces (a_i, b_i) would show same numbers.</keep>
- Paragraph 25, Sentence 4: <keep>While on front face, edges are only in one cycle.</keep>
- Paragraph 26, Sentence 1: <keep>After verifying that such cycles can exist in polyhedrons like cubes and applying graph theory concepts, I concluded that constructing such routes is possible.</keep>
- Paragraph 26, Sentence 2: <keep>Hence, the answer is "Yes."</keep>
