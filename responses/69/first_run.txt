Okay, I need to solve this problem where positive integers a and b satisfy an equation involving an infinite sum of trigonometric terms. The goal is to find a + b. Let me start by understanding the given equation:

The equation is 1/(a + √b) equals the sum from i=0 to infinity of sin²(10°/3^i) divided by cos(30°/3^i). All angles are in degrees. 

First, I note that each term in the sum has angles that decrease by a factor of 3 each time. For example, when i=0, the angles are 10° and 30°, and as i increases, the angles get smaller (like 10°/3, 30°/3, then 10°/9, 30°/9, etc.). 

I recognize that for each term, the angle in the sine function is θ_i = 10°/3^i, and the angle in the cosine function is 3θ_i (since 30°/3^i = 3*(10°/3^i) = 3θ_i). Therefore, each term is sin²(θ_i)/cos(3θ_i). 

To handle the infinite sum, I need to find a way to telescope the series. A telescoping series can be expressed as the difference of consecutive terms, so when summed, most terms cancel out. To achieve this, I explore trigonometric identities. 

One crucial identity is that sin²θ can be written as (1 - cos(2θ))/2. Plugging this into the term gives [1 - cos(2θ_i)]/(2 cos(3θ_i)). However, this doesn't immediately help. Another approach is needed.

By examining the angles, I notice that θ_i = θ_{i-1}/3. This recursive relationship suggests a telescoping pattern. After some manipulation, I use the identity for secant (1/cos) and find that each term can be expressed as (1/4)(sec(θ_{i-1}) - sec(θ_i)). 

Summing these terms from i=0 to infinity results in a telescoping series where most terms cancel out. The remaining terms are sec(θ_{-1}) (which is sec(30°)) and the limit as θ_i approaches 0 (which is sec(0°) = 1). This simplifies the sum to (1/4)(sec(30°) - 1).

Calculating sec(30°) gives 2/√3. Therefore, the sum becomes (1/4)(2/√3 - 1). Rationalizing this expression, I find it equals (2√3 - 3)/12. Setting this equal to 1/(a + √b), I solve for a + √b by rationalizing the denominator:

1/(a + √b) = (2√3 - 3)/12 → a + √b = 12/(2√3 - 3). Rationalizing the denominator involves multiplying numerator and denominator by (2√3 + 3), leading to a + √b = 12 + 8√3. 

From here, identifying a and b as positive integers, I find a = 12 and √b = 8√3, so b = (8√3)² = 192. Summing these gives a + b = 12 + 192 = 204.
