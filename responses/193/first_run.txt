Okay, let me go through this step by step. The user is asking me to identify which tokens in the provided reasoning are essential for future steps. The goal is to wrap these tokens in <keep> tags to optimize the reasoning process.

First, I need to understand the problem and the existing reasoning. The problem involves determining the electric potential inside and outside a spherical shell with a surface charge density σ(θ) = 4 cos(θ). The reasoning uses multipole expansions, calculates the total charge, dipole moment, and applies boundary conditions to find the potentials.

Now, I have to pinpoint which parts of this reasoning are crucial for continuing the solution. Let's break down the key steps:

1. **Total Charge Calculation**: The total charge Q is found by integrating σ(θ) over the sphere. The integral results in Q = 0, which is essential because it eliminates the monopole term, leaving the dipole term.

2. **Dipole Moment Calculation**: The reasoning computes the dipole moment p_z by integrating the charge distribution. This is critical because the potential outside depends on the dipole moment.

3. **Boundary Conditions**: The application of boundary conditions at r = R is vital. The potential must be continuous, leading to a relation between the coefficients A and B. The discontinuity in the electric field relates the coefficients to the surface charge density, which determines their values.

4. **Final Expressions for Potentials**: The resulting potentials inside (phi_in) and outside (phi_out) are derived from these coefficients, directly leading to the correct answer choice B.

Each of these steps contributes essential information. The integrals, the derived coefficients, and the application of boundary conditions are all necessary for arriving at the solution. Without these parts, the reasoning would be incomplete or incorrect.

Now, I'll go through the reasoning text and mark the sections that contain these essential steps. I need to ensure that the <keep> tags encapsulate complete sentences or phrases exactly as they appear. The focus is on parts that establish key formulas, results of integrals, boundary conditions, and final expressions.

For example:

- The calculation showing Q = 0 must be kept because it justifies ignoring the monopole term.
- The integral for the dipole moment p_z, including substitution steps and the final result, is necessary to understand the dipole contribution.
- The boundary conditions application and the resulting equations linking A and B are crucial for solving the coefficients.
- The final expressions for phi_in and phi_out directly lead to the answer choice, so they must be retained.

I'll go through each paragraph, identify these key elements, and mark them with the appropriate <keep> tags. This way, future reasoning steps can quickly reference these critical results without reprocessing the entire detailed calculations.
