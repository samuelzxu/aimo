Alright, let me try to figure this problem out. So, we have six vectors on a board: the standard basis vectors and their negatives in three dimensions. The move involves replacing two vectors v and w with (v + w)/√2 and (v - w)/√2. The goal is to find the maximum possible length of the sum vector u after some number of moves.

First, I need to understand what each move does. When replacing two vectors, their sum changes. The initial sum is zero because all vectors cancel out. But after some moves, the sum can become non-zero. Let me compute how the sum changes with each move.

Replacing v and w gives new vectors (v + w)/√2 and (v - w)/√2. Adding these new vectors gives √2 v. So, the total sum changes by replacing v + w with √2 v. This means each move can adjust the sum based on the vectors chosen.

An important invariant here is the sum of the squares of all vectors. The initial sum of squares is 6, as each vector has length 1. Each move preserves this sum because replacing v and w with the new vectors maintains the total squared length. This invariant will constrain the maximum possible sum.

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, the square of the sum of vectors is at most 6 times the sum of the squares, but here the sum of squares is fixed at 6. So, |u|² ≤ 6 * 6 = 36, but this is too loose. A better approach is to use the identity |u|² = Σ|vi|² + 2Σvi·vj. Since Σ|vi|² = 6, maximizing |u|² requires maximizing the sum of the inner products.

The maximum sum of inner products occurs when vectors are aligned. However, starting with vectors in opposite directions, through moves, we can create vectors along the same axis. For example, replacing (1,0,0) and (-1,0,0) gives a vector (√2, 0, 0) and a zero vector. Similarly for other axes. This results in three vectors along each axis with length √2 and three zeros. Their sum is (√2, √2, √2), which has length √6.

Testing other combinations shows that while some moves increase the sum temporarily, the maximum sustainable sum due to the invariant is indeed √6. Thus, the maximum possible length of u is √6.

To identify the essential tokens for future reasoning steps, we analyze the key points and invariant mentioned in the problem-solving process:

1. **Invariant Calculation**: The sum of the squares of all vectors remains constant at 6.
2. **Cauchy-Schwarz Application**: The maximum possible length of the sum vector is derived using the invariant and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.
3. **Optimal Vector Alignment**: By combining vectors to align them along the same axis, the maximum sum is achieved.

Here are the essential tokens marked for future reasoning:

- Paragraph 4, Sentence 1: <keep>The sum of the squares of the vectors is preserved.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 2: <keep>Each move preserves the sum of the squares of the vectors.</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 1: <keep>Sum of squares is 6 * 1 = 6.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 1: <keep>By Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, |S|² ≤ 6 * Q</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 2: <keep>Q = 6, |S|² = Σ|vi|² + 2 Σvi·vj</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 1: <keep>Maximum Σvi·vj occurs when vectors are aligned.</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 1: <keep>Replacing pairs to create vectors along each axis</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 2: <keep>Sum (√2, √2, √2) with length √6.</keep>
- Paragraph 14, Sentence 1: <keep>Cauchy-Schwarz gives theoretical maximum.</keep>
- Paragraph 14, Sentence 2: <keep>Testing combinations confirms √6 as maximum.</keep>

These selections highlight the invariant preservation, key inequality application, and the optimal strategy for vector alignment.
