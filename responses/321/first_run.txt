Alright, let's tackle this pH problem step by step. The solution involves mixing H₂CO₃, NaHCO₃, Na₂CO₃, and NaOH, each 0.01 mol in 100 mL of water. The goal is to determine the resulting pH given the pKa values of H₂CO₃ (6.37 and 10.32) and log 2 = 0.30.

First, let's identify the roles of each component. H₂CO₃ is a weak acid, NaHCO₃ is amphoteric (can act as acid or base), Na₂CO₃ is a strong base (from CO₃²⁻), and NaOH is a strong base. When these are mixed, reactions occur between the strongest acid (H₂CO₃) and strongest base (NaOH) first. 

The reaction between H₂CO₃ and NaOH consumes both, producing HCO₃⁻. This leaves us with HCO₃⁻ (from both the reaction and original NaHCO₃) and CO₃²⁻ (from Na₂CO₃). The remaining species form a buffer system between HCO₃⁻ (acid) and CO₃²⁻ (base), governed by the second dissociation (pKa2 = 10.32).

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:
pH = pKa2 + log([CO₃²⁻]/[HCO₃⁻])
Substituting the concentrations (0.1 M CO₃²⁻ and 0.2 M HCO₃⁻):
pH = 10.32 + log(0.1/0.2) = 10.32 - 0.30 = 10.02

This calculation hinges on accurately tracking the moles after reactions, recognizing the buffer system, and applying the correct pKa and logarithmic values provided.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 4: <keep>H2CO3 is a weak acid. Its two dissociation steps have pKa1 = 6.37 and pKa2 = 10.32.</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 5: <keep>NaHCO3 is sodium bicarbonate, which is the sodium salt of the bicarbonate ion (HCO3−). Since it's the salt of a weak acid (H2CO3) and a strong base (NaOH), HCO3− can act as a weak base or a weak acid (amphoteric).</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 6: <keep>Na2CO3 is sodium carbonate, the sodium salt of carbonate ion (CO32−). This is a stronger base than bicarbonate because it's the second dissociation.</keep>
