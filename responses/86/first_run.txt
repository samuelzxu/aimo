Okay, let's tackle this problem. The goal is to find the minimum value of the integral of a product of four functions chosen from x, sin x, and cos x over the interval [0, π/2]. The key is to determine which combination of four functions (allowing repetition) results in the smallest integral.

First, I'll note that sin x and cos x are between 0 and 1 on this interval, while x ranges from 0 to π/2 (approximately 1.5708). Since x can be greater than 1 in part of the interval, products involving x might increase the integral. Therefore, focusing on combinations of sin x and cos x could lead to smaller integrals.

Considering products of sin x and cos x, trigonometric identities can simplify the integrals. For example, sin²x cos²x can be rewritten using double-angle identities, leading to a simpler integral. Specifically, sin²x cos²x = (sin 2x)² / 4 = (1 - cos 4x)/8. Integrating this over [0, π/2] gives π/16.

Evaluating other combinations involving x, such as x sin³x or x cos³x, results in larger integrals compared to π/16. Even combinations with one x and three trigonometric functions (e.g., x sin x cos²x) yield integrals around 0.222, which is larger than π/16 ≈ 0.196.

Thus, the minimal integral occurs when the product consists of two sin x and two cos x functions, which simplifies to sin²x cos²x. This combination integrates to π/16, the smallest value among all considered possibilities.
