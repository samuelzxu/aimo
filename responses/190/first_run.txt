Okay, I need to figure out which parts of this long reasoning are essential to keep for future steps. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the user starts by explaining the problem about the density of states for rotons. They describe the energy dispersion relation and the answer choices. This setup is important because it gives the context, so maybe some key formulas here need to be kept.

Then there's a detailed derivation of the density of states using the given dispersion relation. The user solves for p in terms of E, considers the two possible solutions (p1 and p2), and computes the derivative dE/dp. They mention integrating in momentum space and converting to energy, which leads to the formula involving the sum of contributions from both p1 and p2. This part seems crucial because it's the core of the calculation.

Next, the user expands the squared terms (p1^2 + p2^2) and simplifies them. This step shows how the final expression for the density of states combines both solutions. Keeping this simplification is important as it directly leads to the conclusion.

The user then checks the answer choices against their derived formula. They match their result with option (D), explaining why other options (B) and (C) only account for single contributions. This comparison is essential for validating the correct answer.

Finally, they confirm their conclusion by considering specific cases like E approaching Delta and cross-checking units and behavior. These checks are important to ensure the formula's validity.

Key parts to retain are the derivation steps involving solving for p, the derivative dE/dp, summing contributions from both p1 and p2, simplifying the squared terms, matching with option (D), and validation through specific cases. These elements capture the critical reasoning needed to arrive at the correct answer.
