Okay, let's break down how I approached solving this problem. First, I needed to visualize the triangle and all the points mentioned. The sides given were 15, 20, and 25, which I recognized as a Pythagorean triple, confirming it's a right triangle with legs PR=15 and QR=20, and hypotenuse PQ=25. The next step was understanding the positions of points A, B, C, D, E, and F on the respective sides of the triangle.

I assigned coordinates to the triangle for easier calculations. Setting R at (0,0), P at (0,15), and Q at (20,0) made sense since PR and QR are the legs. Then, I determined the coordinates of each point by moving the specified distances along the sides. For example, point A is 5 units from P on PQ, which translated to coordinates (4,12) using parametric equations or unit vectors.

Once all coordinates were established, using the shoelace formula to calculate the area of hexagon ABCDEF was the logical step. Listing the coordinates in order and applying the formula gave an area of 120. To verify, I checked the remaining areas of three smaller triangles outside the hexagon, which summed to 30, matching the total triangle area of 150. This confirmed the hexagon's area as 120.

Key steps included recognizing the triangle's right angle, correctly positioning points using distances, and applying the shoelace formula accurately. Ensuring coordinates were precise was crucial to avoid errors in the final calculation.
