Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. First, let me try to visualize the triangle and all the points mentioned. The triangle is PQR with sides PR=15, QR=20, and PQ=25. Hmm, those numbers seem like a Pythagorean triple, right? 15-20-25. Let me check: 152 + 202 = 225 + 400 = 625, which is 252. Yes! So triangle PQR is a right triangle with the right angle at R, since PR and QR are the legs and PQ is the hypotenuse.

So, in my mind, I can imagine triangle PQR where angle R is the right angle. Now, points A and B are on PQ, points C and D are on QR, points E and F are on PR. The lengths given are PA=5, QB=5, QC=5, RD=5, RE=5, and PF=5. I need to find the area of hexagon ABCDEF.

First, let me sketch this mentally. PQ is the hypotenuse of the right triangle, length 25. Points A and B divide PQ into segments PA=5, AQ=20, then QB=5, so actually from P to A is 5, A to Q would be 20, but the problem says points A and B lie on PQ, with PA=QB=5. Wait, hold on. If PA=5 and QB=5, then starting from P, go 5 units to A, then from Q, go 5 units towards P to B. So the distance from B to Q is 5, so distance from B to P would be PQ - QB = 25 - 5 = 20. Wait, but how much is AB? So, PA=5, QB=5, then PQ is 25. So the positions of A and B on PQ: A is 5 units from P, and B is 5 units from Q, so the distance between A and B would be PQ - PA - QB = 25 - 5 - 5 = 15. So AB is 15 units? Hmm, so A is 5 from P, B is 5 from Q, AB is 15.

Similarly, points C and D are on QR, with QC=5 and RD=5. QR is 20, so if QC=5, then CR=15. Wait, but also RD=5. Since QR is 20, starting from Q, C is 5 units along QR, then from R, D is 5 units back towards Q, right? Wait, so QR is 20, point C is 5 units from Q, so CQ=5, so CR is QR - QC = 20 - 5 = 15. Then, point D is 5 units from R on QR. Since QR is from Q to R, RD=5 means D is 5 units away from R, so DQ would be QR - RD = 20 -5=15? Wait, but then from Q to C is 5, from R to D is 5. So the distance between C and D would be QR - QC - RD = 20 -5 -5=10. So CD is 10 units.

Similarly, points E and F lie on PR. PR is 15 units. RE=5 and PF=5. Since PR is from P to R. PF=5 means starting from P, moving 5 units along PR to F. So PF=5, so FR= PR - PF = 15-5=10. Then, RE=5, which is on PR? Wait, PR is from P to R. If E is on PR with RE=5, that means starting from R, moving towards P 5 units to E, so PE=PR - RE=15 -5=10. So positions on PR: PF=5, so F is 5 from P, and E is 5 from R. So PE=10 and FR=10. So the distance between E and F on PR would be PR - PE - FR = 15 -10 -10, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe overlapping? Maybe not. Wait: PR is from P to R. E is 5 units away from R, so E is 10 units from P, because PR is 15. Similarly, F is 5 units from P, so FR is 10 units. So from P to F is 5, F to E is PE - PF =10 -5=5? Wait no, if E is 10 units from P and F is 5 units from P, then the distance from F to E would be 5 units. So yes, FE is 5 units. So points E and F divide PR into three parts: 5,5,5? Wait, no. From P: 5 to F, then 5 more to E? No, if E is 10 units from P and F is 5 from P, then the distance between F and E is 5. So on PR, we have P----5----F----5----E----5----R. So yes, PR=15 is broken into 5,5,5.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says points E and F lie on PR with RE=PF=5. Hmm. So RE=5, meaning E is 5 units from R; PF=5, meaning F is 5 units from P. So that would place F 5 from P, and E 5 from R. Therefore, FE would be PR - PF - RE =15 -5 -5=5, which matches. So FE is 5. So yes, E and F divide PR into sections of 5,5,5. Okay.

Now, the hexagon is ABCDEF. Let me try to visualize how this hexagon is formed. Starting from A on PQ, then moving to B? Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me make sure. The hexagon is ABCDEF, which means starting at A, then going to B, then C, then D, then E, then F, then back to A. Wait, but I need to confirm how these points are connected. The problem says "hexagon ABCDEF", so the order is A connected to B, B connected to C, C connected to D, D connected to E, E connected to F, F connected to A.

But the points are on different sides. Let me check the positions:

- A and B are on PQ,

- C and D are on QR,

- E and F are on PR.

So the sequence is:

A on PQ â†’ B on PQ would seem to create a line segment AB on PQ, but in the hexagon, after B comes C, which is on QR, so after B, moving from PQ to QR via C? Similarly, after D on QR, moving to E on PR, then to F on PR, and back to A on PQ. Hmm.

Wait, this hexagon is sort of going around the triangle, connecting these points on different edges.

Let me try to sketch the triangle:

- Let me assign coordinates to the triangle for easier calculations. Since it's a right triangle at R, let's set point R at the origin (0,0). Then, since PR=15 and QR=20, let's assign coordinates: point P at (0,15) since PR is vertical; point Q at (20,0) because QR is horizontal, QR=20. Wait, but PQ should be 25. Wait:

Wait, hold on. If R is at (0,0), PR is one leg, QR is the other leg. Let me double-check:

If PR=15 and QR=20, so if R is (0,0), then P would be (0,15) and Q would be (20,0). Then PQ would be from (0,15) to (20,0), distance sqrt((20)^2 + (-15)^2)=sqrt(400 + 225)=sqrt(625)=25. Yes, that matches. So triangle PQR with coordinates: R(0,0), P(0,15), Q(20,0), right?

Yes. Now, assigning coordinates will probably help. Let's set this up:

Coordinates:

15

P(0,15)

|

|

| R(0,0)

Q(20,0)

So PR is vertical from (0,15) to (0,0). QR is horizontal from (0,0) to (20,0). PQ is the hypotenuse from (0,15) to (20,0), length 25. Alright.

Now, let's find coordinates for points A, B, C, D, E, F.

Starting with points A and B on PQ.

PQ is from P(0,15) to Q(20,0). Let's parameterize PQ. The parametric equations:

From P(0,15) to Q(20,0). The vector is (20, -15). So any point on PQ can be expressed as P + t*(20, -15), where t is from 0 to 1.

So point A is 5 units from P along PQ. The total length of PQ is 25, so 5 units is 1/5 of the total length. Therefore, t = 5/25 = 1/5. So coordinates of A: x = 0 + 20*(1/5) = 4, y = 15 + (-15)*(1/5)=15-3=12. So A is at (4,12).

Wait, actually another way: Compute the coordinates using the distance from P. The direction vector from P to Q is (20, -15). To move 5 units along this vector from P. The length of the direction vector is 25, as given. So unit vector in PQ direction is (20/25, -15/25) = (4/5, -3/5). So moving 5 units from P: displacement is 5*(4/5, -3/5) = (4, -3). So starting at P(0,15), adding (4,-3) gives A(4, 12). Yep, same as above.

Similarly, point B is 5 units from Q on PQ. So moving from Q towards P, 5 units along PQ. So t here would be 5/25=1/5 again, but from Q's side. Alternatively, since from Q to P is direction (-20,15), unit vector (-4/5, 3/5). Moving 5 units from Q: displacement is 5*(-4/5, 3/5)=(-4, 3). So starting at Q(20,0), adding (-4,3) gives B(16,3). Let's confirm:

Coordinates of B: So PQ is from Q(20,0) to P(0,15). Moving 5 units from Q towards P. As before, direction vector is (-20,15), length 25, unit vector (-4/5, 3/5). So displacement is 5*(-4/5,3/5)=(-4,3). New coordinates: 20 -4=16, 0 +3=3. Hence, B is at (16,3).

Alright, points A(4,12) and B(16,3) on PQ.

Now, points C and D on QR. QR is from Q(20,0) to R(0,0). Wait, QR is given as 20 units. Wait, QR is given as 20, but according to coordinates, QR is from Q(20,0) to R(0,0), which is length 20. So QC=5. So point C is 5 units from Q towards R(0,0). Since QR is along the x-axis from (20,0) to (0,0), moving 5 units from Q(20,0) towards R: x-coordinate decreases by 5, so x=20-5=15. So point C is at (15,0). Similarly, RD=5. Since R is at (0,0), moving 5 units along QR (which is towards Q), so D is at (5,0). Wait, QR is from Q(20,0) to R(0,0). So from R(0,0), moving 5 units towards Q(20,0) would be along the x-axis to (5,0). So point D is at (5,0).

But let me confirm. QC=5: point C is 5 units from Q on QR. QR is 20 units from Q to R. Therefore, QC=5, so CR=QR-QC=20-5=15. Similarly, RD=5: point D is 5 units from R on QR. So from R(0,0), 5 units towards Q(20,0) is (5,0). So point D is at (5,0). Then DC is QR - QC - RD = 20 -5 -5=10, so C(15,0) and D(5,0), which are 10 units apart. Correct.

Now, points E and F on PR. PR is from P(0,15) to R(0,0), vertical line at x=0. PF=5: point F is 5 units from P along PR. Since PR is 15 units long, from P(0,15) down to R(0,0). Moving 5 units from P: y-coordinate decreases by 5. So F is at (0,15-5)=(0,10).

Similarly, RE=5: point E is 5 units from R on PR. Since PR is from R(0,0) to P(0,15), moving 5 units from R(0,0) up is (0,5). So E is at (0,5). So checking: PF=5: F(0,10) is 5 units from P(0,15). RE=5: E(0,5) is 5 units from R(0,0). Then, distance between E and F is 5 units: (10 -5)=5. Correct.

Now, we have all coordinates:

A(4,12)

B(16,3)

C(15,0)

D(5,0)

E(0,5)

F(0,10)

So hexagon ABCDEF is the polygon with vertices in that order.

Now, to find the area of hexagon ABCDEF. One way to calculate the area is to use the shoelace formula, which can compute the area of a polygon given its vertices' coordinates. Since all six points have coordinates, this seems feasible.

But before jumping into that, let's visualize again:

Starting at A(4,12), moving to B(16,3), then to C(15,0), then to D(5,0), then to E(0,5), then to F(0,10), and back to A(4,12). Let me make sure the connections make sense. From A to B: going from (4,12) to (16,3). Then to C(15,0): that would be a straight line from B(16,3) to C(15,0). Then to D(5,0): connects C(15,0) to D(5,0). Then to E(0,5): from D(5,0) to E(0,5). Then to F(0,10): up the y-axis from (0,5) to (0,10). Then back to A(4,12). Hmm, that last part from F(0,10) to A(4,12) seems a diagonal line.

Alternatively, the shoelace formula should compute the area regardless. Let me confirm the order of the points is correct as per the problem statement. The hexagon is ABCDEF, so the order is important. So A, B, C, D, E, F, back to A. Okay. Let's proceed.

To use the shoelace formula, list the coordinates in order, repeating the first at the end:

A(4,12)

B(16,3)

C(15,0)

D(5,0)

E(0,5)

F(0,10)

A(4,12)

Compute the sum of x_i * y_{i+1} minus x_{i+1} * y_i for all i.

Let me compute step by step:

First, list all pairs:

1. A to B: (4,12) to (16,3)

   x_i * y_{i+1} = 4*3 =12

   x_{i+1} * y_i=16*12=192

   Difference:12 - 192= -180

2. B to C: (16,3) to (15,0)

   x_i=16, y_{i+1}=0; 16*0=0

   x_{i+1}=15, y_i=3; 15*3=45

   Difference:0 -45= -45

3. C to D: (15,0) to (5,0)

   x_i=15, y_{i+1}=0; 15*0=0

   x_{i+1}=5, y_i=0;5*0=0

   Difference:0 -0=0

4. D to E: (5,0) to (0,5)

   x_i=5, y_{i+1}=5;5*5=25

   x_{i+1}=0, y_i=0;0*0=0

   Difference:25 -0=25

5. E to F: (0,5) to (0,10)

   x_i=0, y_{i+1}=10;0*10=0

   x_{i+1}=0, y_i=5;0*5=0

   Difference:0 -0=0

6. F to A: (0,10) to (4,12)

   x_i=0, y_{i+1}=12;0*12=0

   x_{i+1}=4, y_i=10;4*10=40

   Difference:0 -40= -40

Now, sum up all the differences:

-180 (from AB) + (-45) (BC) +0 (CD) +25 (DE) +0 (EF) +(-40) (FA) =

-180 -45 +25 -40 = (-180 -45) + (25 -40) = (-225) + (-15) = -240

Take absolute value and divide by 2. Therefore, area = | -240 | /2 = 120.

Wait, so the area is 120? But the triangle's total area: since it's a right triangle with legs 15 and 20, area is (15*20)/2=150. If the hexagon area is 120, then the area outside the hexagon is 30. Seems plausible?

Wait, let me check again my calculations for possible errors.

Starting with the shoelace formula:

Computed terms:

AB: 4*3 -16*12 =12 -192= -180

BC:16*0 -15*3=0 -45= -45

CD:15*0 -5*0=0 -0=0

DE:5*5 -0*0=25 -0=25

EF:0*10 -0*5=0 -0=0

FA:0*12 -4*10=0 -40=-40

Total: -180 -45 +25 -40= -240. Absolute 240. Half is 120.

Another way to compute shoelace formula is to alternate in pairs:

Sum of x_i y_{i+1}:

4*3 +16*0 +15*0 +5*5 +0*10 +0*12 =

12 +0 +0 +25 +0 +0=37

Sum of y_i x_{i+1}:

12*16 +3*15 +0*5 +0*0 +5*0 +10*4 =

192 +45 +0 +0 +0 +40=277

Then area is |37 -277| /2 = | -240| /2=120.

Yes, same result. Hence, area of the hexagon is 120. But the triangle has area 150, so subtract the three corners' areas: around R(0,0), near Q(20,0), near P(0,15). But no, maybe that's not necessary. Alternatively, 120 seems correct. But let me reason if this answer makes sense.

The hexagon is large, covering most of the triangle except three small regions. The triangle area is 150, and the hexagon is 120, so remaining area is 30, which would likely be the three small triangles near each corner. Let me check those triangles:

1. Triangle APF: point A(4,12), P(0,15), F(0,10). Need to find its area.

Using coordinates:

APF: coordinates (4,12), (0,15), (0,10). Shoelace formula:

4*15 -0*12 +0*10 -0*15 +0*12 -4*10

Wait, maybe better to calculate using coordinates:

The triangle with vertices (0,15), (4,12), (0,10). Wait, this is a polygon. Let's use shoelace:

Coordinates:

(0,15), (4,12), (0,10), (0,15)

Sum x_i y_{i+1}:

0*12 +4*10 +0*15=0+40+0=40

Sum y_i x_{i+1}:

15*4 +12*0 +10*0=60+0+0=60

Difference:40 -60=-20. Area= | -20 | /2=10.

2. Triangle BQC: points B(16,3), Q(20,0), C(15,0).

Coordinates:

(16,3), (20,0), (15,0), (16,3)

Sum x_i y_{i+1}:

16*0 +20*0 +15*3=0+0+45=45

Sum y_i x_{i+1}:

3*20 +0*15 +0*16=60 +0 +0=60

Difference:45 -60= -15. Area=| -15 | /2=7.5

3. Triangle DRE: points D(5,0), R(0,0), E(0,5)

Coordinates:

(5,0), (0,0), (0,5), (5,0)

Sum x_i y_{i+1}:

5*0 +0*5 +0*0=0 +0 +0=0

Sum y_i x_{i+1}:

0*0 +0*0 +5*5=0 +0 +25=25

Difference:0 -25= -25. Area=| -25 | /2=12.5

Total area outside the hexagon:10 +7.5 +12.5=30. So 150-30=120. Thus confirms the hexagon area is 120. So this answer is correct.

But I remember in the problem statement it says points C and D lie on QR, but in my solution point D is on QR. Wait, in coordinates QR is from Q(20,0) to R(0,0); C is at (15,0), D at (5,0). So both on QR.

Similarly, E and F are on PR. Check. A and B on PQ. Check. Then the connections ABCDEF, passing through all those points. The shoelace calculation for the hexagon area as 120, confirmed by subtracting the three corner triangles with total area 30. Therefore, 150-30=120.

Thus, the answer is \boxed{120}

**Final Answer**
\boxed{120}
