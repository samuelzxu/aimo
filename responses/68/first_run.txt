Okay, let's start by understanding the problem. We need to find the number of integer values of \( k \) in the interval \([-500, 500]\) such that the equation \(\log(kx) = 2\log(x+2)\) has exactly one real solution. 

First, consider the domain restrictions for logarithms:
- \(\log(kx)\) requires \( kx > 0 \).
- \(\log(x+2)\) requires \( x > -2 \).

Rewriting the equation using logarithm properties:
\[
\log(kx) = \log((x+2)^2) \implies kx = (x+2)^2
\]
This simplifies to the quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0
\]

Analyzing the quadratic equation's discriminant \( D = k(k - 8) \):
- **Discriminant Cases**:
  - \( D > 0 \) (two real solutions) when \( k < 0 \) or \( k > 8 \).
  - \( D = 0 \) (one real solution) when \( k = 0 \) or \( k = 8 \).
  - \( D < 0 \) (no real solutions) when \( 0 < k < 8 \).

Since \( k = 0 \) leads to \(\log(0)\), it's invalid. Thus, \( k = 8 \) is a valid solution.

**For \( k > 8 \)**:
- The quadratic equation has two positive roots, both valid since \( x > 0 \), leading to two solutions. Hence, excluded.

**For \( k < 0 \)**:
- The quadratic equation has two negative roots. However, due to the domain \( -2 < x < 0 \), only one root lies within this interval. Thus, all \( k < 0 \) yield exactly one solution.

**Counting valid \( k \)**:
- Negative integers from \(-500\) to \(-1\) (500 values).
- \( k = 8 \) (1 value).

Total valid \( k \) values: \( 500 + 1 = 501 \).
