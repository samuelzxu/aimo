Okay, let's start by identifying the essential parts of the reasoning trace that are necessary for future steps. The user needs to perform two iterations of the Müller method and find the value of x₃. 

First, the initial points x₀=0.25, x₁=0.5, x₂=1 and their function values are crucial. The calculations for f(x₀), f(x₁), and f(x₂) must be retained because they form the basis for constructing the quadratic polynomial.

Next, the parameters h₀, h₁, δ₀, and δ₁ are computed from these points. These values are critical for determining the coefficients a, b, and c of the quadratic polynomial, which are used to find the next approximation x₃. 

The detailed computation of coefficients a, b, and c, especially with their precise values, is vital. The discriminant calculation and the choice of the denominator's sign are essential steps that directly influence the value of x₃. 

Since the problem mentions two iterations, but the answer requires x₃, it's important to note that the first iteration's result (x₃≈2.1573) is the solution. The confusion about the number of iterations might arise, but the detailed calculation for the first iteration must be highlighted.

Key elements include the formula for Müller's method, the selection of the root closest to x₂, and the incremental step calculation. Retaining the precise numerical values ensures accuracy in the final result.

Finally, verifying the answer by constructing the quadratic polynomial and solving for its roots confirms the correctness of x₃. The final answer, rounded to three decimal places, is necessary for the boxed result.
