Alright, let's break this down. The user wants me to identify which parts of the existing reasoning are crucial for future steps. I'll start by reading through the entire thought process carefully.

First, the problem is about calculating the refractive power of glasses for a farsighted student. Key elements here are the near-point distance (63 cm), the reading distance (20 cm), and the distance of the glasses from the eyes (1.5 cm). The formula used is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di, with attention to converting distances from the eye to the lens.

The reasoning goes through adjusting the object and image distances for the glasses' position. The object distance (book to lens) is 20 cm - 1.5 cm = 18.5 cm. The image distance (near point to lens) is 63 cm - 1.5 cm = 61.5 cm, but since it's a virtual image, the sign is negative. Converting these to meters and plugging into the lens formula gives the focal length and then the refractive power.

I need to mark the essential steps where these calculations are done. The key points are:

1. Adjusting distances from eye to lens.
2. Using the lens formula with correct signs.
3. Converting units from cm to meters.
4. Calculating the reciprocal for diopters.

Important sections include the conversion steps, the lens formula application, sign conventions for virtual images, and final calculation. I'll ensure these parts are marked with <keep> tags to retain critical info for future steps without redundancy.
