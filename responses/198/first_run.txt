Okay, let's start by identifying the essential parts of the reasoning that need to be retained for future steps. 

First, the problem setup includes the potential energy function and the goal of finding the average potential energy. The key equations and definitions here are crucial. For instance, the definition of u(r) and a’ = (2πd³ε)/3 must be kept because they are fundamental to the calculations.

Next, the integral setup for the average potential energy is central. The user explains that the average potential energy comes from integrating u(r) multiplied by the number density (N/V) and the volume element 4πr²dr from d to infinity. This part is essential as it forms the basis of the calculation.

The transformation of the integral and the simplification steps are also important. Specifically, substituting u(r) into the integral, changing variables, evaluating the integral limits, and approximating for large V are all critical steps. The user makes a key approximation by extending the upper limit to infinity due to the r⁻⁶ decay, which needs to be highlighted.

The substitution of a’ into the final expression is another vital part. The step where they express the integral result in terms of a’ by relating 4πεd³/3 to 2a’ must be kept, as this directly ties the answer to the given parameters.

Each of these steps contains equations and logical transitions that are necessary for deriving the final answer. Missing any of these could make the reasoning incomplete. The user also verifies the units and cross-checks with standard derivations like the van der Waals equation, which reinforces the validity of the steps, so these validations should be retained as well.

Finally, the conclusion where they present the final answer boxed is necessary as the end result. All these parts ensure that anyone continuing the reasoning has the crucial mathematical and conceptual foundation to proceed without redundant recalculations.
