Okay, so I need to figure out which parts of the provided reasoning are essential to keep for future steps. Let me go through the thinking process step by step.

First, the problem involves evaluating an infinite series that excludes the term where k equals m. The series is expressed using partial fractions decomposition, which is a crucial step here. The decomposition leads to breaking down each term into simpler fractions, which then allows the series to telescope. 

The key parts here are the partial fraction decomposition and the resulting sums. The transformation of the original series into a telescoping series is vital. The user correctly identifies that the divergent harmonic series components cancel out when subtracted, leaving a finite sum.

The critical steps include:
1. Partial fraction decomposition of 1/[(k + m)(k - m)] into (1/(2m))(1/(k - m) - 1/(k + m)).
2. Splitting the series into two sums and reindexing them.
3. Recognizing the telescoping nature and handling the exclusion of the k=m term.
4. Simplifying the sums to find the resulting expression 3/(4m²).

These steps involve specific mathematical manipulations and insights that are necessary for arriving at the final answer. The test cases for m=1 and m=2, while helpful for verification, might not be essential for future reasoning but the core algebraic steps are.

I'll need to ensure that all essential equations and transformations are marked, particularly where partial fractions are applied, the reindexing of sums, and the cancellation of divergent parts leading to the final simplified expression.
