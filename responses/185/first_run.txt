Okay, I need to figure out which parts of the reasoning are essential to keep for future steps. Let me go through each paragraph and see which sentences are crucial.

First paragraph introduces the problem. The key part here is relating the minimum number of transpositions to the cycle decomposition, specifically f(σ) = 7 - m where m is the number of cycles. That formula is critical for the rest.

Second paragraph verifies the formula with examples. The conclusion that the formula holds is important here.

Third paragraph shifts to calculating the sum over all permutations. The key point is breaking it down to 7*7! minus the sum of cycles, which relies on knowing f(σ) = 7 - m. So the equation sum f(σ) = 7*7! - sum m(σ) is essential.

Fourth paragraph introduces the harmonic number H_n for average cycles. The connection between the sum of m(σ) and H_7 *7! is vital here.

Then, the calculation of H_7 as 363/140 must be kept because it's needed for the final sum.

Next, computing the total sum of cycles (13068) using H_7 *5040 is necessary for the next step.

The final calculation steps leading to 22212 are crucial as they provide the answer. Each arithmetic step here must be preserved to follow how the answer is derived.

The verification for smaller n=1, n=2, n=3 is important to confirm the formula works, which supports the approach.

The conclusion reaffirming the answer using the formula and harmonic numbers is key to solidifying the result.
