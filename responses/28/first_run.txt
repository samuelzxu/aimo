Okay, let's go through the thinking process and identify the essential tokens needed for future reasoning steps.

First, part (a) involves proving all conics through points O, A, B, G are hyperbolas. The key steps here are setting up coordinates, substituting points into the general conic equation, deriving the relationship between coefficients, and analyzing the discriminant. The critical tokens here are the coordinate setup, the equations after substitution, the discriminant calculation, and the conclusion about positivity.

For part (b), finding the locus of centers, the essential steps involve solving for the center coordinates (h, k) using the conic's center equations, substituting relationships between coefficients, and deriving the quadratic equation. The crucial parts here are the system of equations for the center, substitution of coefficients A and C in terms of B, h, and k, and the final quadratic equation representing the ellipse.

The key tokens to preserve include the equations after substituting O, A, B, G into the conic, the derived relations between coefficients (like B in terms of A and C), the discriminant analysis, and the steps leading to the quadratic equation for the locus.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 2: <keep>Let me set point O at the origin (0,0), A at (a,0), and B at (0,b). Then, centroid G would be the average of the coordinates of O, A, B. So, G is at \( \left( \frac{a}{3}, \frac{b}{3} \right) \).</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 1: <keep>The equation of a conic is \( Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0 \). Since it passes through O(0,0), substituting (0,0) gives F=0. So the equation reduces to \( Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey = 0 \).</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 4: <keep>Substitute point A(a,0) into the equation: \( Aa^2 + D a = 0 \) ⇒ \( A a + D = 0 \) ⇒ D = -A a.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 7: <keep>Similarly, substitute point B(0,b): \( C b^2 + E b = 0 \) ⇒ \( C b + E = 0 \) ⇒ E = -C b.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 1: <keep>So now, the equation becomes \( Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 - A a x - C b y = 0 \).</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 3: <keep>Simplify each term: First term: \( A a^2 /9 \), Second term: \( B ab /9 \), Third term: \( C b^2 /9 \), Fourth term: \( -A a^2 /3 \), Fifth term: \( -C b^2 /3 \).</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 7: <keep>\( (-2A a^2 - 2C b^2) + B ab = 0 \).</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 8: <keep>Thus, \( B = \frac{2A a^2 + 2C b^2}{ab} = 2 \left( \frac{A a}{b} + \frac{C b}{a} \right) \).</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 1: <keep>Compute \( B^2 = 4 \left( \frac{A^2 a^2}{b^2} + 2AC + \frac{C^2 b^2}{a^2} \right) \).</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 3: <keep>Simplify: \( 4A^2a^2/b^2 + 4AC + 4C^2b^2/a^2 \).</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 6: <keep>The quadratic form is positive definite because the determinant is positive and the leading coefficient a2/b2 > 0.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, \( B^2 -4AC = 4*(positive terms) \), so it's positive.</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 1: <keep>The center of a hyperbola given by the general equation is found by solving the system: \( 2Ax + By + D = 0 \), \( Bx + 2Cy + E = 0 \).</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 4: <keep>Substitute D and E: \( A(2h -a) + B k = 0 \), \( C(2k - b) + B h = 0 \).</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 6: <keep>Express A and C in terms of B: \( A = -B k / (2h -a) \), \( C = -B h / (2k -b) \).</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 8: <keep>Substitute into \( B ab = 2A a^2 +2C b^2 \): \( B ab = 2*(-B k a^2 / (2h -a) ) + 2*(-B h b^2 / (2k -b) ) \).</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 1: <keep>Simplify to get \( ab(2h -a)(2k -b) = -2 k a^2 (2k -b) - 2 h b^2 (2h -a ) \).</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 5: <keep>Final equation: \( 4ab hk +4b2 h2 +4a2 k2 -4a b2 h -4a2b k +a2b2=0 \).</keep>
- Paragraph 14, Sentence 1: <keep>In normalized variables x = h/a, y = k/b, the equation becomes \( 4x2 +4xy +4y2 -4x -4y +1=0 \), representing an ellipse.</keep>
