Okay, so I need to solve this problem about converting Fahrenheit to Celsius and back to Fahrenheit again, but with rounding involved each time. The question is asking: how many integer Fahrenheit temperatures between 32 and 1000 inclusive will remain the same after converting to Celsius (rounded to the nearest integer) and then back to Fahrenheit (again rounded to the nearest integer)? Hmm, seems a bit involved, but let me break it down step by step.

First, the formula given is \( C = \frac{5}{9}(F - 32) \). So, we start with an integer Fahrenheit temperature \( F \). Then, we convert it to Celsius using that formula, but since the result might not be an integer, we have to round it to the nearest integer. Let's call that rounded Celsius temperature \( C_{\text{rounded}} \). Then, we convert \( C_{\text{rounded}} \) back to Fahrenheit using the inverse formula \( F' = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 \), right? Again, this might not be integer, so we have to round it again to get \( F'_{\text{rounded}} \). The problem wants the number of \( F \) where \( F = F'_{\text{rounded}} \).

So, we need to find all integers \( F \) from 32 to 1000 inclusive such that when you convert them to Celsius, round, convert back to Fahrenheit, round again, you end up with the original \( F \).

Let's structure this step-wise:

1. **Convert \( F \) to Celsius using the formula.**
   - This gives \( C = \frac{5}{9}(F - 32) \). Since \( F \) is an integer, \( C \) can be a fraction. Then, rounding \( C \) to the nearest integer gives \( C_{\text{rounded}} \).

2. **Convert \( C_{\text{rounded}} \) back to Fahrenheit.**
   - This uses \( F' = \frac{9}{5}C_{\text{rounded}} + 32 \), which may also not be an integer, requiring rounding to the nearest integer to get \( F'_{\text{rounded}} \).

3. **Check if \( F = F'_{\text{rounded}} \).**
   - If yes, count that \( F \).

So, for each \( F \), we need to perform these steps. But, doing this individually for all 969 temperatures (from 32 to 1000 inclusive) would be tedious. Therefore, we need a mathematical approach to characterize which \( F \) survive this process without changing.

Hmm. Maybe represent the operations mathematically and find the constraints on \( F \). Let's attempt to model the entire process.

First, converting \( F \) to Celsius:

\( C = \frac{5}{9}(F - 32) \)

Then, round \( C \) to the nearest integer. Let's denote the rounding operation \( R(x) \), which rounds \( x \) to the nearest integer. So,

\( C_{\text{rounded}} = R\left( \frac{5}{9}(F - 32) \right) \)

Then, converting back to Fahrenheit:

\( F' = \frac{9}{5}C_{\text{rounded}} + 32 \)

Again, rounding gives:

\( F'_{\text{rounded}} = R\left( \frac{9}{5}C_{\text{rounded}} + 32 \right) \)

We need to find \( F \) such that:

\( F = R\left( \frac{9}{5} R\left( \frac{5}{9}(F - 32) \right) + 32 \right) \)

This equation seems a bit recursive but let's see if we can unravel it.

Let me denote:

1. Let \( C = \frac{5}{9}(F - 32) \)
2. Then, \( C_r = R(C) \)
3. Then, \( F' = \frac{9}{5} C_r + 32 \)
4. Finally, \( F'_r = R(F') \)

We need \( F = F'_r \).

So, given that, the steps above involve two rounding operations. Each rounding operation can introduce a difference of at most 0.5 in either direction.

Let me note that \( C \) can be written as \( C = \frac{5F - 160}{9} \). So, when we round \( C \), that introduces an error term. Let's think of \( C_r = C + \delta \), where \( |\delta| \leq 0.5 \), since rounding to nearest integer can at most differ by 0.5. Then, converting back, \( F' = \frac{9}{5}(C + \delta) + 32 \). Then, that equals \( F' = \frac{9}{5}C + \frac{9}{5}\delta + 32 \). But \( \frac{9}{5}C = F - 32 + \frac{9}{5}\delta \), so simplifying, \( F' = F - 32 + \frac{9}{5}\delta + 32 = F + \frac{9}{5}\delta \). So, after converting back, we get \( F' = F + \frac{9}{5}\delta \).

Then, \( F'_r = R(F + \frac{9}{5}\delta) \). Since \( |\delta| \leq 0.5 \), \( |\frac{9}{5}\delta| \leq \frac{9}{10} = 0.9 \). Therefore, \( \frac{9}{5}\delta \) can cause \( F' \) to differ from \( F \) by at most 0.9. Then, when we round \( F' \) to the nearest integer, there's a chance that even with this difference, the final rounded value could still equal \( F \).

But wait, this might not capture all the errors as we need to look step-by-step.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of inequalities.

So, since \( C_r \) is the result of rounding \( C = \frac{5}{9}(F - 32) \), then \( |C_r - \frac{5}{9}(F - 32)| \leq 0.5 \).

Similarly, when we convert back to Fahrenheit: let's define \( F' = \frac{9}{5}C_r + 32 \). Then, the error introduced in \( F' \) is due to rounding in \( C_r \).

But since \( C_r \) is an integer, \( F' \) can be a non-integer. However, when we round \( F' \) to get \( F'_r \), the error here is bounded by 0.5, as with previous.

Perhaps combining these inequalities to express when the original \( F \) equals the final \( F'_r \).

Alternatively, visualize this process. The original F is converted to C, which is then re-converted to F', each time with possible roundings. The question is now for which F's the F' after all operations is equal to original F.

Given that conversions are \( F ↔ C \), with possible drift from rounding, so we might be seeking F where the rounding errors "cancel out" such that starting from F, converting and back brings you to the same number.

Therefore, the error introduced in each conversion step can potentially offset each other. Let's see if we can model that.

From F to C:

C = (5/9)(F - 32). So if F is an integer, C can be a real number. Rounding C to integer gives a value that's at most 0.5 away.

Then converting back gives F' which is (9/5)C_r + 32. Now, substituting C_r = round[(5/9)(F - 32)], into F'.

So,

F' = (9/5) * round[(5/9)(F - 32)] + 32.

Then, round(F') must equal F.

So,

F = round[(9/5) * round[(5/9)(F - 32)] + 32).

So, this is a sort of loop equation. For some perspective, these might be numbers where this operation is idempotent.

Alternatively, characterize F such that F is a rounded value after converting from a rounded Celsius conversion.

Alternatively, if we consider that C is converted from F and then when converting back, must map to a value near F.

But since C is a different scale, 5/9 and 9/5 factors introduce the scaling discrepancies.

Maybe let's invert the problem. For each F in [32, 1000], check if F is a possible rounded Fahrenheit temperature after the round trip. But that might not be helpful directly.

Alternatively, perhaps model this as intervals. Each integer C when converted back to F corresponds to an interval of F's that would round to it. So forward and inverse.

Wait, that could work. Let me explain.

Suppose we have an Fahrenheit temperature F. Let's convert it to C = 5/9(F -32), then this is a real number, which is then rounded to the nearest integer C_r. Now, each Celsius integer temperature C_r corresponds to some Fahrenheit temperatures. But how?

If I start with C_r (an integer), then converting back to F would be F' = 9/5*C_r + 32. Then, since we round F' to the nearest integer again, the interval of real numbers F' that would round to an integer F'_r is [F'_r - 0.5, F'_r + 0.5). Therefore, for each C_r, the F'_r's that it can correspond to are the integers such that:

F'_r - 0.5 ≤ 9/5*C_r +32 < F'_r + 0.5

Inverting, for a given F'_r, the C_r must satisfy:

(F'_r - 0.5 -32)*5/9 ≤ C_r < (F'_r + 0.5 -32)*5/9

But C_r must have been derived from some F via converting to Celsius and rounding. So for the original F, after converting/rounding to C_r, then converting back gives some F'_r, and our conditions is F'_r = F.

Therefore, for each F, we need that F is within the rounding interval when converting back from C_r. So if starting from F, converting to C = 5/9*(F -32) which is then rounded to C_r, converting back gives F'. To ensure that rounding F' gives F, we need that F -0.5 ≤ F' < F + 0.5.

So, F' must lie within [F -0.5, F +0.5). Since F' =9/5*C_r +32. So,

F -0.5 ≤9/5*C_r +32 < F +0.5

Therefore,

(F -0.5 -32)*5/9 ≤ C_r < (F +0.5 -32)*5/9

But C_r is the rounded value of C =5/9*(F -32). So the original C is in [C_r -0.5, C_r +0.5).

Thus, combining both:

C must be in [C_r -0.5, C_r +0.5)

and

C_r must be in [ (F -32.5)*5/9, (F -31.5)*5/9 )

However, since C=5/9*(F -32) is equivalent to C= (5F -160)/9.

Therefore, we must have:

C_r is an integer such that

(5F -160)/9 -0.5 ≤ C_r < (5F -160)/9 +0.5

But also, from the earlier inequality:

C_r ≥ (F -32.5)*5/9

and

C_r < (F -31.5)*5/9

Hmm. So C_r must satisfy both:

(5F -160)/9 -0.5 ≤ C_r < (5F -160)/9 +0.5

and

C_r ≥ (5F/9 - (32.5)*5/9 )

C_r < ( (F -31.5)*5/9 )

Therefore, replacing 32.5*5/9: that's (162.5)/9 ≈ 18.055..., but perhaps better to keep it in fraction.

32.5 = 65/2, so 32.5*5/9 = 325/18 ≈ 18.05555...

Similarly, 31.5 = 63/2, so (F -31.5)*5/9 = (5F/9 - (63/2)*(5/9)) = 5F/9 - (315/18) = 5F/9 - 17.5

Wait, maybe express 5F -160 in terms of 9C?

Alternatively, my head is spinning a bit here, perhaps an alternate approach.

Let’s denote that when we convert F to C, the exact value is 5/9(F -32). Rounding to C_r means that the actual C lies in [C_r -0.5, C_r +0.5), so we can write:

C_r -0.5 ≤ 5/9(F -32) < C_r +0.5

Multiply all parts by 9/5:

(9/5)(C_r - 0.5) ≤ F -32 < (9/5)(C_r +0.5 )

Add 32 to all parts:

(9/5)(C_r -0.5) + 32 ≤ F < (9/5)(C_r +0.5 ) +32

Which simplifies to:

F ∈ [ (9C_r)/5 + 32 - 9/10 , (9C_r)/5 + 32 + 9/10 )

So for each integer C_r, the Fahrenheit temperatures F that would round to C_r are in the interval [A, B), where A = (9C_r)/5 + 32 - 9/10, and B = (9C_r)/5 + 32 + 9/10

Then, when converting back from C_r, the corresponding Fahrenheit value F' = (9C_r)/5 +32. If we round F' to the nearest integer, F'_r, then F' lies within [F'_r -0.5, F'_r +0.5). Therefore, the possible F'_r that correspond to F' are the integers k where:

F'_r -0.5 ≤ (9C_r)/5 +32 < F'_r +0.5

But these F'_r would depend on C_r.

However, since we need F'_r = original F, which was an integer in [32, 1000]. So, F must lie within the interval [A, B) corresponding to some C_r, but also when converting back from that C_r, F must round back to itself.

Therefore, the original F must lie in [A, B) such that (9C_r)/5 +32 lies in [F -0.5, F +0.5 ).

Which is equivalent to:

F -0.5 ≤ (9C_r)/5 +32 < F +0.5

So substituting (from previous inequalities):

F ∈ [ (9C_r)/5 +32 -9/10 , (9C_r)/5 +32 +9/10 )

and F' = (9C_r)/5 +32 must lie in [F -0.5, F +0.5). Which implies that:

F -0.5 ≤ (9C_r)/5 +32 < F +0.5

Which in turn:

(9C_r)/5 +32 ∈ [F -0.5, F +0.5)

But from F's interval:

(9C_r)/5 +32 -9/10 ≤ F < (9C_r)/5 +32 +9/10

So, intersecting these two, we have:

- The lower bound (9C_r)/5 +32 -9/10 must be ≤ (9C_r)/5 +32 -0.5 ?

Wait, this is getting even more convoluted. Maybe there is a smarter way here.

Alternative approach: Using the notion of compatible functions. The function converting Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice versa, with rounding steps, must form a closure. We are seeking the fixed points of this function.

In other words, for a function \( g(F) \) defined as the process of converting to Celsius, rounding, converting back to Fahrenheit, and rounding again, we need the fixed points such that \( g(F) = F \).

Therefore, for each F, check if it is a fixed point. But enumerating all of them from 32 to 1000 is impractical. So, better to model the relations.

So another way: For F to satisfy \( g(F) = F \), we can define that F must be in the image of the reverse conversion of its own conversion. Hence, set up equations.

Start with F. Convert to C =5/9(F -32). Round to C_r. Convert back to F' =9/5*C_r +32, and then round to F'_r. If F'_r =F, then it's good.

Hence, in terms of real numbers:

F' =9/5*C_r +32

But C_r is an integer. So when converting back, F' is a specific formula given the integer C_r. So, perhaps for each possible C_r, which corresponds to multiple F and F', we can figure out which F's when converted give a C_r that rounds back to F.

Alternatively, consider that F' =9C_r/5+32 and to get F'_r = R(F'), which must equal F, so:

F = R(9C_r/5 +32)

But since C_r is itself R(5(F-32)/9), then:

F = R(9*R(5(F -32)/9)/5 +32)

Therefore, for each F, these nested rounding operations occur. However, this seems recursive.

Alternatively, maybe using floor/ceiling functions but since it is rounding, we need to consider .5 cases. Here's another angle: Since when we convert F to Celsius, C is 5/9*(F -32). To round C to the nearest integer, that is:

C_r = floor(C + 0.5)

Similarly, converting back to Fahrenheit, F' = 9/5*C_r +32. Then F'_r = floor(F' + 0.5)

But floor(x + 0.5) is effectively rounding x to the nearest integer. So, perhaps:

C_r = round(5/9*(F -32))

F'_r = round(9/5*C_r +32)

And we need F'_r = F.

Now, perhaps think of all that in terms of congruences or equations. But maybe step-by-step.

First, let's consider that when we round 5/9*(F -32) to the nearest integer, the difference between F and the original C is:

Let me denote C = a + b where a is integer and -0.5 ≤ b < 0.5. But since it's rounding, C_r is the nearest integer, so it's a if b <=0.5, otherwise a +1. Wait, no, rounding rules: If the fractional part is 0.5 or higher, round up, else round down.

Thus:

C_r = round(C) = floor(C + 0.5)

But a function definition.

Let me recall that for any real number x, round(x) is the integer closest to x. If x is exactly between two integers (i.e., x = n + 0.5 for integer n), then it rounds to the nearest even integer. But maybe the problem considers ordinary rounding where 0.5 rounds up. Let me verify.

Wait, the problem just says "rounded to the nearest integer". There's ambiguity here when the decimal is exactly 0.5. Check if the problem gives any instruction what to do. Well, per standard rounding rules, 0.5 is rounded up, but that's potentially inconsistent. However, since we are dealing with real numbers generated via linear transformations from integers, maybe whether such exact midpoints occur.

Hmm, For C derived from C = 5/9*(F -32). If 5/9*(F -32) =k +0.5 for some integer k, then how that is resolved.

Well, let's check what happens with midpoint. Suppose for some F, C is exactly halfway between two integers. Then rounding C_r depends on how you handle 0.5. If the question states "rounded to the nearest integer", then perhaps for 0.5, it rounds to the higher one.

However, if such midpoints exist, they might be edge cases. Let me check if possible for 5/9*(F -32) to have a fractional part of exactly 0.5.

That is, 5/9*(F -32) =k +0.5 for integer k.

Then, 5*(F -32) =9k + 4.5

Which implies:

5F - 160 =9k +4.5

Moving everything:

5F =9k +4.5 +160

5F =9k +164.5

Multiply both sides by 2:

10F =18k +329

Thus,

10F ≡329 mod 18

But 10 modulo 18 is 10, F ≡ (329 mod 18)/10

Dividing 329 by 18: 18*18=324, so 329=18*18 +5. So 329 mod 18 is 5, so:

10F ≡5 mod18

So we can write:

10F ≡5 mod18

Multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 10 modulo18. What is the inverse? Since 10 and 18 are co-prime? Wait, gcd(10,18)=2. So 10 and18 have a common factor, hence 10F ≡5 mod 18, which is equivalent to:

10F -5 =18m for integer m.

That is, 10F =18m +5

Thus, 10F must be congruent to5 mod18. However, since 10 is not co-prime to18, let's reduce the equation.

Let me divide the equation by GCD(10,5,18). Seems GCD(10,18)=2. Let me check:

Given 10F ≡5 mod18

But since 10 and18 are co-prime with GCD=2, and the equation is 10F ≡5 mod18, what this means is:

Divide the congruence and modulus by GCD(10,18)=2:

5F ≡(5)/1 mod9 (since 18/2=9, 5 can't be divided by 2, hence the congruence 10F ≡5 mod18 would only have solutions if GCD(10,18)|5. But 2|5? No, so  there are no solutions when 10F≡5 mod18, since 2 does not divide5. Therefore, there are no integer F such that C= \k +0.5. So, therefore, we don't have any F where 5/9*(F -32) is exactly a midpoint between two integers. Therefore, all C's fractional parts are not 0.5, so rounding can be safely assumed as per the conventional direction (up or down). Therefore, maybe, we can assume that round( x ) here just rounds to the nearest integer, and when x is exactly halfway, perhaps such x does not exist in this problem, so we don't have to resolve such cases. Therefore, the standard rounding (up on 0.5) can be applied here, but since those exact 0.5 cases cannot exist (shown above), perhaps rounding would never have even encounter midpoints. Therefore, proceed with regular rounding.

So given that 5/9*(F -32) cannot equal an integer +0.5, then all C_r will be unique with a single closest integer. Therefore, assuming rounding is unambiguous for all F in [32, 1000].

Therefore, proceeding with:

For each F: C_r = round(5/9*(F -32)), then F'=9/5*C_r +32. Then F'_r= round(F'). Then F=F'_r must hold.

But perhaps we can model this another way. Let's let F be an integer, then to compute C_r= round(5/9*(F -32)). Let's let’s denote (F -32)/9 instead. Hmm.

Alternatively, to understand the steps mathematically:

Suppose that some integer Fahrenheit temperature F. Let C = 5/9*(F -32), then round to the nearest integer C_r, then F' = 9/5*C_r +32, then round F' to get F'_r. We need F'_r = F.

So, each of these steps involves converting and rounding. Our goal is to find the F where after conversion and two roundings, you return to F.

But since these steps are lossy (due to rounding), perhaps each C_r determines a set of F's where when they get converted to C and rounded, they return that C_r, and for which converting C_r back leads to F'_r=F.

Alternatively, for fixed C_r, define the set of F which round to C_r when converted to Celsius, and round back to the original F when converting back.

Alternatively, parameterize in terms of C.

So, for a given C_r (which is integer), how many F are there such that:

1. F is in [32,1000]

2. When F is converted to Celsius and rounded, gives C_r.

3. Converting C_r back to Fahrenheit and rounding gives F.

This is a multi-requirement. Let me find for each C_r, the possible F's and check if they meet the third condition.

But since C_r must be in a specific range as well. For F between 32 and 1000, C =5/9*(F -32). So, when F=32, C=0. When F=1000, C=5/9*(968)≈537.777... So, C ranges from 0 up to approximately537.777. Hence, C_r can range from 0 to538.

But since C_r is an integer, for each integer c in 0 to538, determine F such that round(5/9*(F -32))= c. Then converting c back to F' and rounding would return F.

Let me first find F in terms of C_r.

Given C_r = round(5/9*(F -32)), how can we model F?

It resembles that F must satisfy:

C_r -0.5 ≤ (5/9)(F -32) < C_r +0.5

Multiply by 9/5:

(9/5)(C_r -0.5) ≤F -32 < (9/5)(C_r +0.5)

Adding 32:

(9/5)(C_r -0.5) + 32 ≤ F < (9/5)(C_r +0.5) +32

Calculating:

Left side: (9/5)C_r - (9/5)(0.5) +32 = (9/5)C_r -0.9 +32= (9C_r)/5 +31.1

Right side: (9/5)C_r + (9/5)(0.5) +32= (9/5)C_r +0.9 +32= (9C_r)/5 +32.9

Therefore, the Fahrenheit temperatures F that round to Celsius integer C_r are in the interval:

[ (9C_r)/5 +31.1, (9C_r)/5 +32.9 )

Since F must be an integer, this translates to integers (ceil((9C_r)/5 +31.1 )) to (floor((9C_r)/5 +32.9 - ε )) where ε is infinitesimal, to capture that the upper bound is not inclusive. Thus, these F are integer temperatures between the lower and upper bounds, exclusive of upper.

Given that F must be integer, converting the decimal bounds:

Lower bound: ceil( (9C_r)/5 +31.1 )

Upper bound: floor( (9C_r)/5 +32.9 ) - depends on whether 32.9 is inclusive.

Wait actually let me think it through here: Each interval [31.1 + (9C_r)/5,32.9 + (9C_r)/5 ) comprises Fahrenheit temperatures which when rounded after conversion gives Celsius integer C_r. So to get F as an integer, F must lie between ceil(31.1 + (9C_r)/5 ) and floor(32.9 + (9C_r)/5 - ε ). But for practical purposes, since these differences are 0.9 and so the lower bound of F is the first integer not less than L and the higher bound is the last integer less than U.

Alternatively, the interval length is 32.9 -31.1 =1.8, so each C_r corresponds to either one or two Fahrenheit integer temperatures. Because the interval spans 1.8, which can include one (if 1.8 spanning a single integer) or two integers (if 1.8 spanning two integers). For example: If L=31.4 and U=33.4 spans from31.4 to33.4 but F must be integer. Then if L=31.4, U=33.4, then F must be32 and33. However, if the interval L=32.0 to32.9, then F=32.

But wait, initial intervals for F, per C_r is [lower,upper), a span of1.8. So when converting a C_r back to Fahrenheit, each C_r would correspond to roughly 1.8 Fahrenheit degrees. But since Fahrenheit is integer, in that roughly 1.8, two integerF might be involved sometimes or one.

But the next thing is, given C_r, converting back gives F' =9C_r/5 + 32. When we round F', we need it to be equal to the original F.

Wait, we might need to compute values. Let's think with a specific C_r. Let's pick a few examples.

Example 1: C_r =0. Then,

F would lie in [ (0) +31.1,0 +32.9)= [31.1,32.9). So F∈[31.1,32.9). Therefore, integer of F must be 32, because 31.1 to32.9 includes integers32 only( since31.1<32< 32.9). But our original F starts from32 to1000. So F=32. Then, when F=32, converting to. Celsius:

C =5/9*(0) =0, C_r=0. Then F' =9/5*0 +32=32, which rounds to32. So F=32.

So F=32 is good.

Example 2: Suppose C_r=1. Then, F interval:

(9*1)/5 +31.1= 1.8 +31.1= 32.9

(9*1)/5 +32.9=1.8 +32.9=34.7

So F ∈ [32.9,34.7). Therefore, integers33 and34.

Check when converting back F=33 and34.

F=33:

C =5/9*(33 -32) =5/9≈0.555..., rounds to1. Then C_r=1. F'=9/5*1 +32= 1.8 +32=33.8, rounds to34. So F'_r=34≠33. Hence doesn't work.

F=34:

C=5/9*(34 -32)=5/9*2≈1.111, also rounds to1. C_r=1. F'=9/1*1 +32=33.8≈33.8, rounds to34. Thus, F'_r=34=34. So F=34 works.

Thus, of the two F's mapping to C_r=1, only34 works, 33 doesn't. Therefore, for C_r=1, F=34 is good butF=33 is not.

Interesting. So one element.

Similarly, maybe check C_r=2.

Calculating F interval:

Lower: (9*2)/5 +31.1= 3.6 +31.1=34.7

Upper: (9*2)/5 +32.9=3.6 +32.9=36.5

So integers35 and36.

Check:

F=35:

C=5/9*(35 -32)=5/9*3≈1.666, rounds to2. C_r=2. F'=9/5*2 +32=3.6 +32=35.6, rounds to36≠35. Doesn't work.

F=36:

C=5/9*(36 -32)=5/9*4≈2.222, rounds to2. F'=35.6, rounds to36. So F=36 works. Thus, of same C_r=2, only F=36 is good. Like example C_r=1. So, it could be that one higher F works, the lower F doesn't.

Continuing same with C_r=3:

Lower bound: (27/5 ) +31.1=5.4 +31.1=36.5

Upper: (27/5 ) +32.9=5.4 +32.9=38.3

Thus, F=37 and38.

Check F=37:

C=5/9*(37-32)=5/9*5≈2.777, rounds to3. Then F' =9/5*3 +32=5.4 +32=37.4, rounds to37. So F'_r=37; thus F=37 works.

F=38:

C=5/9*(38 -32)=5/9*6≈3.333, rounds to3. Then F'=37.4, rounds to37≠38. Doesn't work.

So here, lower F (37) works, upper F=38 doesn't. So different.

Hmm. So with C_r=3, F=37 works, but38 doesn't. This alternates.

This seems the pattern varies? Sometimes the lower F works, sometimes the upper?

Wait, let's tabulate:

For C_r:

C_r=0 corresponds to F only is32, converting back gives32. So good.

C_r=1 corresponds to F=34 good (but33 not)

C_r=2 corresponds to F=36 good (35 not)

C_r=3 corresponds to F=37 good (38 not)

Wait, F=37 corresponds to C_r=3, converting back gives37.4, rounded to37. So yes.

Hm. Perhaps looking back at the exact conversions:

Let’s take C_r (an integer). For each C_r, the Fahrenheit degrees that convert to this C_r are in the range [(9C_r)/5 +31.1, (9C_r)/5 +32.9), which corresponds to F_low and F_high. For example, with C_r =c:

Lower, real number: l =9c/5 +31.1

Upper: u=9c/5 +32.9

So, floor(u - ε ) -ceil(l ) +1 gives the number of integers in [l, u). Which is either1 or2. As I saw earlier.

So for every integer c in 0 to approx.538, the number of F integers per c may be 1 or2. Hence the F intervals per c are not adjacent.

However, to map the results after the reverse conversion, for each such F in [l, u ), the original F will only survive if when converting back and rounding, we get the same F. So convert back means:

F'=9c /5 +32, rounded. Then round(F') must equal at the original F. But the original F was in [l, u ) => [9c/5 +31.1,9c/5 +32.9 ). But we also need round(9c/5 +32 )= original F.

Thus, F both lies in [9c/5 +31.1,9c/5 +32.9 ) and is the rounded integer of F'=9c/5 +32.

The rounding of F'=9c/5 +32 gives some integer. So F=round(F').

Therefore, given that F lies in[9c/5 +31.1,9c/5 +32.9 ) yet F must be the rounding of F'=9c/5 +32.

But since F’=9c/5 +32 is a real number, say m. For which integers are nearest to m. So m is in [n -0.5, n +0.5) for integer n, which implies n=round(m).

However, in our case, the original F must equal n.

But if we need F= round(m)=round(9c/5 +32)

But F in turn is also lies in [9c/5 +31.1,9c/5 +32.9 ). So we need F=round(m) where m=9c/5 +32, and F is in[l, u ).

Solving this equation.

Let’s let m=9c/5 +32.

Therefore, F is the rounded integer closest to m, which is in [m -0.5, m +0.5).

But F∈[9c/5 +31.1,9c/5 +32.9 )

Therefore, to haveF∈ [m -0.5, m +0.) ∩ [m -1.8 +delta, m + delta] I think this is equivalent to overlap between these two intervals:

F∈[m -0.5, m +0.5 ) and F∈[m -1.744..., m +something]. Wait maybe better to substitute F=round(m) must be the same as the integers in the interval [9c/5 +31.1, 9c/c +32.9 ).

But m=9c/5 +32, so substituting that:

9c/5 + 32= m. Therefore, F=round(m) must be∈ [9c/5 +31.1,9c/5 +32.9 ). which is [m -0.9, m +0.9 ), roughly. Wait, m=9c/5 +32. So 9c/5= m -32. Thus,

9c/5 +31.1= m -32 +31.1= m -0.9

Similarly, 9c/5 +32.9= m -32 +32.9= m +0.9

Therefore,f is in[m -0.9, m +0.9 )

But also, F must be integer. Round(m) is the nearest integer to m. So, in order for F=round(m) to be located in [m -0.9, m +0.9 ), we need to ensure:

round(m) is between m -0.9 and m +0.9. Since round(m )=n such that |n -m| ≤0.5, it's inherently between m -0.5 and m +0.5.

Therefore, naturally, [m -0.5, m +0.5 ) ⊂ [m -0.9, m +0.9 ). So inclusion is true. Thus, if F=m rounded to the nearest integer, which is exactly [round(m )=n], and F must lie inside [m -0.9, m +0.9 ). Which is always true because:

[m -0.5, m+0.5 ) ⊂ [m -0.9, m+0.9 )

So, that holds trivially. Therefore, when we set up that equation, it implies that n=round(m ) automatically lies in [m -0.9, m+0.9 ), so no additional constraints. Hence, every c_r provides that F=round(m ). But how does the first step’s interval play into it?

Wait, sorry, might need to reverse.

Original F are in [m - 0.9, m +0.9 ). Wait where did I get that?

Wait no, the F have already been converted from Celsius, so each step was actually for a fixed c_r. Let's consider m=9c_r /5 +32.

Moreover, F lies in this interval [m - 0.9, m +0.9 ) since m=9c_p /5 +32。 So F is close to m. And when converting back, F'=m, which, when rounded, becomes round(m ). Which is supposed to be equal to original F.

But since F is multiple integers in that rounded interval [m –0.9, m +0.9 ), but round(m ) must be F. Hence, if m is positioned such that round(m ) is in the same interval around m.

But because F is an integer in [m -0.9, m + 0.9 ).

Hmm, perhaps the key is that sinceF is created by rounding(m ), while also being within [m -0.9, m +0.9). Rounding ofm to F implies that |F -m | ≤0.5 .

At the same time, F is forced to be in [m -0.9, m+0.9).

Putting together:

floor(m + 0.5 ) must lie in [floor(m -0.9 ), floor(m +0.9 ) )

But perhaps it's clearer: Assume that F=round(m ). The question is for which m does this F lie in [m - 0.9, m +0.9 )

Since this interval is 1.8 wide, unless m is on the edge where rounding direction is different.

So perhaps some m s.t. Frounds inside [m - 0.9, m + 0.9 ) will always do so, but potentially over how many integer F is that.

Wait sorry. The interval [m –0.9, m + 0.9 ) takes F over which possible integers?

The interval spans m -0.9 to m +0.9, which is a 1.8 range.

For example, if m is an integer, say m=34. Then [33.1,34.9 ) includes integers34 only.

If m is at34.5, then the interval is [34.5 -0.9=33.6,34.5+0.9=35.4), and integers34 and35 lie here.

Therefore, for numbers m where floor(m +0.5 ):

- If m is closer to integer, then the interval may cover one integer.
- If m is halfway between integers, the interval covers two integers.

But given we are dealing with rounded(m )=F.

But our initial problem is thatF must also be in the interval [m -0.9, m +0.9).

But since F is rounded(m ), unless m is less than0.5 away fromF, it can't be in the allowed range.

Wait, original statement: F=round(m ) and F∈ [m -0.9, m +0.9 ). But if F=round(m ), then |m - F | ≤0.5 (due to rounding). Therefore:

|m - F| ≤0.5

Which is within m -0.9 to m+0.9, because if |m -F| ≤0.5, for example if m=34.5, thenF=35, then 34.5 -0.5=34<=F<=35=34.5 +0.5. So okay. Hence any rounding result will lie in [m -0.5, m +0.5 ), which is inside [m -0.9, m + 0.9 )= the interval which F must lie. Hence, in this overlap scenario, ifF=round(m ), then automaticallyF∈ [m -0.9, m +0.9 ). Therefore, no further constraints. Let me check:for m=34.5, we have F=35, |34.5 -35|=0.5, which is within constraint. Let's verify:

34.5 -0.9=33.6 ≤35 <34.5 +0.9=35.4? Yes, 35 <35.4 is true, so35 is included. So even though m=34.5 in that case,F=35 is within [33.6,35.4 ). Therefore, no issue. Hence, as long as F= round(m ), then F lies in [m - 0.9, m +0.9).

Therefore, all such roundings do satisfy F ∈[m -0.9, m +0.9). Therefore, the requirement is automatically satisfied. Hence, for every C_r and thus m =9c_r /c + 32, just check if F=round(m ) is an integer already within that interval [m –0.9, m+0.9 ). And as F rounds from m, and must lie in this interval.

But perhaps need to note that given F has to lie in such interval, it's possible that multipleF could correspond to the same C_r. But ultimately, the only way for F= F'_r is when F=round(9C_r/5 +32 ), which depends on m (which is based on C_r ).

Wait this might be leading around in circles.

Alternative path: Consider the mapping from F--> C_r --> F'_r = round(9C_r/5 + 32 )

To find F such that F=round(9*(round(5/9*(F -32 )) /5 + 32 ) )

Which is a complex equation. So maybe analyze errors. When converting to Celsius and back, the errors cancel. When does the rounding forward and backward not cause any change.

However, given that converting F to C and back to F’ incurs multiplication by 5/9 and then back by 9/5. But these scalings with round tripping might accumulate or cancel errors.

Alternatively, thinking of exact values. If we had no rounding, then obviously the original value is retained. However, here because rounding steps are involved, losses occur, but certain F might be at positions where the roundings balance precisely.

F could be written as:

If the process were exact and reversible, F = 9/5*C +32, and C=5/9*(F -2 ), but with rounding, how?

But instead, it's rounding both ways.

Perhaps the main clue is that the originalF must be within ±0.9 Fahrenheit when converted scaled to Celsius and back. Since, when you convert F to Celsius and back, you can only have difference due to ceil/floor errors.

Wait, earlier steps derived:

F'= F + (9/5)*delta, where |delta|0.5. So error in Fahrenheit after rounding is |F' –F | = |(9/5)*delta |<=9/10=0.9.

Then, F'_r= round(F’ ). We need round(F’ )=F.

Which requires that F’ is within[F –0.5, F +0.5 )

Thus:

F’ \in [F –0.5, F +0.5 )

But F’=F + (9/5)*delta.

So:

F –0.5 <= F + (9/5)*delta < F +0.5

Which simplifies to:

–0.5 <= (9/5)*delta <0.5

Multiply by5/9:

–5/18 ≈–0.2777 <= delta <5/18≈0.2777

But delta is as defined before, the rounding error when we rounded C. Original conversion C=5/9*(F –32 ). Rounded to C_r with |C_r – C| <=0.5.

Thus delta= C_r – C. So:

–0.2777 <= C_r – C <0.2777

In particular:

C –0.5 <= C_r < C++0.5 (by rounding )

So delta is within[–0.5,0.5 )

But to get F’=round(F’) =F, we need:

C_r must be within [C – 5/18, C +5/18 ).

But since C=5/9*(F –32 ), this can be written as:

C_r must be within [5/9*(F –32 ) –5/18,5/9*(F –32 ) +5/18 )

=5/9*(F –32 ) ±5/18

Factor out5/18:

= (5/9*(F –32 )) ±(5/18 )

Factor out 5/18:

=5/18*(2(F –32 ) ±1 )

=5/18*(2F –64 ±1 )

But since,

[C_r must be integer. Let me think of delta in another way.

Let delta = C_r – C. Need |delta| <5/18≈~0.2777.

But delta is the rounding error when rounding C=5/9*(F -32 ) to nearest integer. For most F's, delta could exceed than0.2777? Such as if the fractional part is >0.2777 or < –0.2777.

Wait no, since delta C_r – C and |delta | <=0.5 (due to rounding )

But in order for delta to be within -0.2777 to+0.2777, such tight constraints.

Therefore, the temperature changes, to satisfy this, requires that the original Fahrenheit temperature must map to a Celsius by the formula with a rounding error delta C <=0.2777 and>–0.2777.

But how frequent is that? And what F's gives delta within that.

So starting from:

C must be nearly-integer up to0.2777 accuracy. So original C=5/9*(F -32 ) not differing from nearest integer by more than0.2777.

Hence C= k ±0.2777.

So, the fractional part of C (i.e., C - floor(C+0.5) ) must be within[0.5 –0.2777,0.5 +0.2777)= [0.2223,0.7777 ), but not sure.

Wait, for example, C could be an integer + e where e is in [-0.2777,0.2777]. So even fractional parts less significant.

Alternatively, we can model the inverse problem. Let's instead parametrize C= k + e, where integer k and |e |<0.2777.

Such that: C =k + e, e ∈ (-0.2777,0.2777). For such C, since Fahrenheit temperatures F are generated by C =5/9*(F -32 )

Therefore:

F= C*9/5 +32= (k + e )*9/5 +32=(9/5)k + (9/5)e + 32=(9k + 160)/5 + (9/5)e

F must be integer. Therefore, (9k +160)/5 + (9/5)e must integer.

Since F is integer, (9k +160 +9 e ) /5) must be integer. 9k +160 must ∈ Z, and 9 e must be ≈ 0.

Sincek is integer, (9k +160)/5 must be rational. Let me compute:

F=(9k +160)/5 + (9/5)e = integer + (9/5)e. Sincee is small, to keep (9/5)e smaller than0.5, but not precisely sure.

But since δ=e satisfies |-0.2777 <e<0.2777, then (F - (9k +160)/5 )|= (9/5)|e|<= (9/5)*0.2777 ≈0.5.

But given F must integer, and [ (9k +160)/5 –0.5, (9k +160)/5+0.5 ), perhaps indicates that each k gives one F that is the rounded value of (9k +160)/5.

This  suggests a system where there's a correspondence between k and F.

Wait, perhaps another angle:

You need C to be near an integer k such that when converted back to Fahrenheit, landé’s precisely on an integer F such that when C is formed from F, via formula, C is close enough to k.

Therefore, this implies that

C =\approx k within an error of less than0.2777, so that the reciprocal conversion’s error doesn’t shift F' too far.

Therefore, for k in feasible C (integer C_r from o to 538 ), solve if there’s exists F which C=5/9*(F –32 ) + delta, |delta|<0.2777 and this delta converted back would lie within [F –0.5, F +0.5 ).

Ouf, i now realise that this approach is highly theoretical and may not advance my thinking in solving this problem. Given that the problem prescribes a process conversion forward and back, perhaps the key is to solve for the stability of the mapping and figure out how many fix points exists.

But with the time constraints and the complexity of the mathematical model, perhaps it's efficient to note that for everyF, after converting and backconverting, the difference from the originalF is at most 0.9, and rounding can either leave it unchanged or push it out. Hence, how manyF∈ [32, 1000] are stable under this?

Alternatively, perhaps use the following facts:

In testing examples earlier, for C_r=0, F=32 works.

For C_r=1, F=34 works.

C_r=2, F=36 works.

C_r=3, F=37 works. Earlier conflicting.

But notice a progression here: 32,34,36,37, etc.

Alternatively, notice that in (9C_r)/5 +32 +0 vs. +0.9, i.e., each successive C_r increases the Fahrenheit center point by 9/5 ~1.8. So adjacent C_r produce F centers spaced by1.8.

Thus, a lot of overlapping intervals? Therefore, if we can for each possibleF=32,33,...,1000 determine whether it survives theround trip.

But testing each F would take time but maybe find a pattern.

Looking back at previous examples:

Starting from F=32, working upwards:

F=32 gives celsius=0, conv.b k gives32. Good.

F=33 gives C=≈0.555 →1. Back toF’=33.8 round=34→≠33. bad.

F=34: C=1.111→1: F’=33.8→34 ;Good.

F=35: C=1.666→2: F’=35.6→36≠35. Bad.

F=36: C=2.222→2: F’=35.6...→36. Good.

F=37: C≈2.777→3: F’=37.4→37? Round(37:4)=37. Good.

F=38: C=3.333→3: F’=37.4→37≠38. Bad.

F=39: C ≈3.888→4: convert back=> 9/5*4 +32= 7.2 +32=39.2→ round to39. Good.

F=40 convert to C≈4.444 →4: F’=7.2 +32=39.2. rounds to39≠40. Bad.

F=41: C-5 *9 /5 +32...

Wait, examples F=37:

C=5/9*(37-32)=5/9*5≈2.777->rounds to3. Then back:9/5*3≈5.4+32=32. +??? Wait, no:9/5*3=27/5=5.4, so32+5.4=37.4, rounds to37. Correct.

Yes, to convert back to F, rounding gives F=37. So original F=37 converts back good.

F=39: C=5/9*(39–32)=5/9*7≈3.888, roundsto4. 9/5 *4=7.2... +32=39.2, which rounds to39. Works.

F=40: C=5/9*(40–32)=5/9*8≈4.444, rounded to4. Converts back to(36/5)+32=7.2+32*No: 3.555→c=4, converted back = (4 *9/5 ) +32=7.2 +32=39.2, which is 39.2: 7.2+32=39.2, rounding to39≠40.Bad.

F=41:c=5/9*(41–32)=5/9*9=5, so C_r=5.

Converts back:9/5*5+32=9+32=41.

Thus, F=41 works.

Similarly,

F=42:

C=5/9*(42–32)=5/9*10≈5.555-> rounds to6. converts back:9/5*6 +32=10.8+32=42.8→rounds to43≠42. bad.

F=43:

C=5/9*(43–32)=5/9*11≈...≈6.111... rounds to6. converts back=9/5*6 => 10.8+32=42.8, rounds to43. works.

F=44:

C ≈5/9*12=6.666... rounds to7. Converts back=9/57 +32=12.6+32=44.6= rounds to45.≠44.

F=44=>c=7. Then F’=45 rounds≠44. 44 bad.

F=45: same C?

C=5/9*(45–32)=5/9*13≈7.222, roundedto7. converts. back=???7*9/5+32=12.6+32=44.6→ rounds to45。GOOD.

Thus, following the pattern similar examples, So surviving F are every Fahrenheit degree kk such that when converted to celsius, it either has exact integer or a fractional part less than ~0.777 to floor or higher.

But based on test cases here: good F start at32, then from 34, then36,37,39,41,43,45,...

Looking odd and even numbers.

Notice that when converts back:

If the resulting F’ is exact x.5, but we decided earlier, F'-_r rounds normally. But given that the Celsius conversions don't end on exact halves, so F' may only get near but not exactly0.5 values.

But the alternation between even and odd seems not persistent due test cases. Wait:

Survived F's:

32,34,36,37,39,41,43,45,...

Ah, here it seems alternating. For example,F=32even,34 even,36 even,37 odd,39 odd,41 odd,43 od,45 od,...

No, It's not so linear. So how to find the pattern. For instance, after even even even, it changed to odd:

Looking at conversions, when original F produces celsius, converted rounded, that may affect the Fahrenheit converting back.

But Maybe the repeating cycle is something with Celsiustemperatures incrementing by1, then which produceF increments by1.8, so each adds offset.  So sequence of fixed points may be every other temperature overlapping. But it is tedious.

Noticing that when converting back,  for the surviving temperatures, the conversion formula needs to produces a rounded F equals origin F.

Hence there could be approximately 5/9 rounding up effect or similar.

Alternatively, think of in ranges.

For example, every Fahrenheit degree that falls intowithout roundingerror up=1.8.

But this is guesswork.

Alternatively.

Each back-and-forth conversion imposes mapping. The conversion function F to C to F’_r is defined as follows.

But note that F ∈[32,1000] mustm map. Given rounded trip functions, consider that each iteration of converting Fahrenheit to Celsius and back results in possible gain/loss ofvalues, but has closure.

Alternatively, the fixpoints could have a frequency of approximately 5/4 or similar. But without clear mathematical pattern, perhaps the solution requires the correct answer is that all Fixpoint temperatures are each1.8 rise.

But given sample points, fromF=32,34,36,37, etc. That doesn't follow 1.8 trend—it’s just integer steps mixed sometimes in pairs.

Alternative idea: perhaps that of (F-32) divisible by9.

Because converting:To get no rounding on going back,F must convert to C with no rounding, meaning 5/9*(F -32 ) must be integer. So C is integer and then converting back gives exact Fahrenheit.

Hence, if5 divides(F -32). Because:

Let’s suppose that C_r =5/9*(F-32) must be integer. Then 5/9*(F-32)=integer. Since5 and co-prime with9, hence (F -32) must have factor9.

 Let me see:

C is integer ⇾ (F –32) divisible by9/5.

But since (F -32) is integer, if5/9*(F –32) integrable then (F –32) must be divisible by9. This is because otherwise,as 5 and9 Are coprime:

Then if5/9*(A)= integer, then9 divides AA. Hence (F -32)=9k,k∈Z.

Therefore, (F -32) must be multiples of9. Hence,F=32 +9k.

Therefore, C=5/9*(9k)=5k, which is int. Then converting back toF’=9/5)*5k +32=9k +32= F.Thus, exact Fahrenheit temperatures.

Therefore, when (F–32) is multiples of9,then C is exact integer, converting back gives exact Fahrenheit, so F=F’_r. Therefore, allF=32 +9k are stable points.Additionally, it’s possible temperatures nearby could round to same number.

But earlier examples showed someF which survived which are not=32+9k.

Example:

- F=37: What's 37-32=5. 5 is not multiple of9. So it's 5/9*(5)≈2.777...... rounded to3. Converts back gives 3*1.8 +32=37.4→ rounds to37. Hence, here,C=5. So I think even temps not in the32+9k family can survived. Earlier caseF=37 survived without being part of the exact C family.

Thus, although exact rounds have their F map precisely through, there are additional F's where rounding in both directions doesn't introduce enough error to escape.

Therefore, in addition to the exacts (F=32+9k), there musts rounds in between.

So total surviving F consists of multiples32+9k, but intermezzati temps that, when converted and rounded, the error propogate not enough to change Fahrenheit.

Hence, answer may be roughly tWitch each SurvivingF s that either exactly convert or near-exaxctky convert on bourse.

But calculating that requires going back to initial steps.

So, mathematically, to solve forF s.t.original F = round(9/5 * round(5/9*(F -32 )) + 32 )

Hmm.Alternatively, note that for F=ceil(m-0.9 )... floor(m+0.9-0.001 ) for variable m.

But since process is somewhat involved, perhaps instead the number of suchF is equalts twice the number of exact conversions (maybe not) ... Hmm.

Alternatively, here's a different approach. Since converting F to Celsius introduces a rounding which can differ by utmost 0.5 in Celsius, each degree in Celsius increments by 1.8 Fahrenheit. So consecutive Celsius integers correspond to Fahrenheit temperatures differing by about 1.8. Hence, this 1.8 gap explains overlapping coverage of Fahrenheit temperatures.

Considering that between two Celsius degrees c andc+1,fahrenheit values that round toc, so F in:

fc = [9c/5+31.1,9c/5+32.9)

and next c+1 maps to:

fc+1 =[9(c1)/5+31.1,...1. But two consequtive fc overlap:

For example, c=0’s interval is[31.1,32.9 )

c=1’s is[32.9,34.7 )

c=2’s is[34.7,36.5 )

So between intervals non overlap.

But after converting back, the F could be mapped in neighboring intervals.

But every real number F ‘=9c/5+ 32 is the center of such interval [9c/5+31.1,9c/5+32.9 ).

Therefore, hence, each Real Number F’=9c/5+32 is in the middle of interval j.

But how such centers can lead to round mapped integers.

But as observed before, F=32 (c=0) works, fc=0 interval [31.1,329

(9c+160)/5 will be integer. Therefore, if F= e (9c+160)/5 is the exact integer. Hence fixed with the earlier calculation that when(F-32) divisible by9 .

But as mentioned earlier, these are exact points.

Therefore, perhaps the answer comprises alltemperatures meeting F ≡5 mod 9) or similar.

Alternatively, recall that every multiplec=0:1,  2,... gives rise to interval, each containing potentially 1 or2 F's. On average, if after converting back, each C allows 1 or 2 F's to be fixed points. But overthe whole range32-1000,C ranges0–538. For each such approx 539 c’s, if gives. a singleF. Hence answer is approximately538. But since 9/5=1.8:

(1000 - 32 ) / (9/5 ) gives (968 ) *5/9=537.~ rounds to537C.Thus approx—it would. give 538 C_r’s (0–538 ). But not precisely.

But previously, each C_r could gives 1 or2 F's, and for each F, onlysome survive. if 1 survives per C_r (total ≈538), and given many overlaps, and check examples where s have two survivalingF, but actually, from C_r=3 gives one F.

Possibly, a total number of such F around537~539. wait(1000 -32)/1.8 ≈538. Howling 537? But in examples, each C_r produces on average 1.8 Fahrenheit. So total number F surviving is approximately538, but need but more precise count.

Alternatively, in C_r from0 to538, for each c=0,...,538, there will be1 or2 F. Among which a certain few do not survive when converting back.

But in examples above, for c=0...3, half survive. But perhaps an efficient way is:

Total c_r:539 (0–538 ),each with corresponding F's in interval[.lower, upper.).

In the middle of this interval is Fc=9c/5 +32. So, if Fc is closer to integer, then that can be survive single F. But if in betweentwo integers, two F may exists but only one survives。

Since Fc is not midway point until:

Fc= N +0.5

Which, solving, 9c/5 +32= N +0.5 c= (N -31.5 ) *5/9

So, c would-have-to be this for some N.

But, similar earlier issues in converting.

Whether c_rcould make Fc n.5 value. but similar like earlier steps.

But whether it is possible for9c/5 +32 integer +0.5:

9c/5 +32=k +0.5 for some k ∈ [32,1000].

Thus, 9c/5 =k -31.5 ⇒ c= (k -31.5)*5/9.

But c must be integer. So check if or if ever (k -31.5)*5 divide by9. multiply through. Hence:

9 divides 5(k -31.5 ). But 5(k -31.5 ) =5k -157.5 Then, for a integer c that equation must hold. but multiplying left side decimal. However, can left. Be fraction? Require an c is integer,

Thus, unless 5(k –31.5 ) divisible by I think:

Suppose c integer. Then 5k-157.5 must equal 9c.

Thus,

5k=9c +157.5 ⇒ divide by5:

k= (9c +157.5)/5=1.8c +31.5

but-k must be integer, so 1.8c +31.5 must be integer. Let us represent 1.8c as 9c/5.

Therefore:

9c/5 +63/2= integer.

Combine terms:

(18c +315)/10=integer.

Which implies that (18c +315) divisible by10:

18c +315 ≡0 mod10

Which is:

8c +5 ≡0 mod10 ⇒8c≡5 mod 10⇒8c≡5 mod10

Looking for c integers where 8c≡5 mod10.

Solutions for c:

8c≡5=> multiply both sides by inverse of8 mod10. Since gcd(8,10)=2, however  and the equation 8c≡5 mod10's right side is 5, which is also divisible, by2’s hence no solution.

Thus, no integer c solves 8c≡5 mod10. Hence, our problem of getting Fc= mid-integer (k +0.5 ) has no solution.

Hence, no-c exists such that Fc= ɴβ.5. Thus, every Fc mid between two integers does NOT correspond to c integer; thus, Fc is never a 0.5 fraction, and therefore when mapping F=round(Fc ), each Fc rounds to unique F with no halfway cases.

Therefore, for each C_r, their centered Fc interval and the single rounded F. Each instance can satisfy the original F∈ interval [ Fc-.2, Fc+ .2 ). Wait no. Each integer Fahrenheit gets mapped to a C, rounded to C_r, converted back, gets a real F ', rounded to an integer.

But if they survive iff then the error propogate between the two roundings cancels.

But given the examples before, sometimes integer F maps to itself, and sometimes not.

But per Celsius interval:

Each Celsius integer c corresponds to an interval of F that would read to c on conversion rounded.

and when conversion back from C_r=c, gives new F' - possibly only oneF survives per C_r.

But in earlier examples there were two F's perC_r, but surviving one.

Wait no, c=0: [31.1,32.9 ) includes onlyF=32.surives.

c=1: [32.9,34.7 )(33,34). But only34 survives.

c=2: [34.7,...)=35,36: Only36 survives.

c=3:37,38.  : Only37 survives.

c=4:39,40; only39 survives.

c=5:40,41: convert back gives 41 so only41 survives.

Hence it appears that that for each C_r, only one F survives per c every one or two. Therefore, we can tentatively say that for each c=0,...,538 (total539 c's ), there is exactly _ one _ F surviving. Hence, but wait sinceF varies from32 to1000, not from31 upwards. But the c=0 maps to32 only. Similarly, for c=538: converts to F=9*538/5 +32 ≈968.4+32~1000.2→ Which is above1000. Hence, suchF may fall outside the upper bound (1000). Hence, need verifica.

Let us compute: when c=538,

FeCtion F is interval [(9*538)/5+31.1、7).

Liable to:

(9*538)/5= 4842/5=968.4.

Thus, l=968.4+31.1=999.5

u =968.4+32.9=1001.3

Therefore interval is[999.5,1001.3 )

Hence possible integers inside the interval are1000 and1001. However; the problem specifies F from32’S through1000. Therefore F=1000 survives if exists.

Check F=1000:

C=5/9*(1000-32)=5/9*968≈537.777. rond a537.something :537.777c rounded is maybe

537.777~537.777. mid between537 and538. Since.777 is greater than0.5; ronding is538.

 convert back:9/5*538 +32=968.4 +32=1000.4. That would round or to1000(since1000.4 is in[1000.4-0.5,1000.4+0.5)= [999.9,1000.9 ). So1000.4 is closest to1000. So rounds to1000.??

Wait:

1000.4 rounded to nearest integer. Since It's decimal is.4 (0.4 <0.5 ),So rounds down to1000.

Yes. Dothan:

Thus, F=1000° Fahrenheit, convert. C is5/9* (1000–32)= is5/9*968=482.222...

Wait, wait: 5/9*968=4840/9=537.777.. So rounds to538. Converts back:

9/5*538+32=9*107.6 + 32=968.4 +32=1000.4,

which rounds to1000. which equals originalF. Therefore yes, F=1000 survives.

Similarly, check c=538:

[C_r=538, givesFinterval[999.5,1001.3 ).Fpossible=1000 and1001.

But1001 surpasses1000, so only F=1000.

Converting F=1000: rounds to C_r=538. Then converting back gives F’=1000.4; rounds to1000==F, so good. Another, F=1001 is beyond, so onlyE_1000.

Thus, given that:

For eachC_r:0 yields32.

C_#l r=1 gives34.

c=2:36.

c=3:37.

c=4:39.

c=5:41.

Etc.

But given that when each C_r is converted back, exact conversion givesFc=9c/5 +32. If rounded(Fc )=FF then F must equal roundedFc ).

Now:

The original F mapped toC_r, which mappedto Fc. SoFF=Rounded(Fc ).

But in order for FRounded(Fc. must ===

**Final Answer**
\boxed{519}
