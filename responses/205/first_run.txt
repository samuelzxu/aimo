Okay, let me figure out which parts of the reasoning are essential to keep for future steps. The problem involves an integral that transforms into a simpler expression using substitutions and known integrals.

First, the substitution steps where they express sin²(t) using the double-angle identity and the substitution s = 2t seem important. Those steps establish the integral's form which leads to the key integral involving (1 - cos(s))cos(xs)/s². 

Next, integrating by parts is crucial because it breaks down the integral into manageable parts. The discussion about evaluating the boundary terms at 0 and infinity shows why certain terms vanish, which is essential for validating the integration by parts approach.

Then, the use of known integrals like ∫₀^∞ sin(kt)/t dt = π/2 for k > 0 is critical. This identity allows the user to compute the transformed integrals after applying the product-to-sum formulas. 

The evaluation of the two main integrals after splitting them using trigonometric identities must be retained. Specifically, the first integral becoming π/2 and the second involving cosine terms reducing to π/2 due to cancellation. This leads to the result that the integral simplifies to (1 - x).

Finally, substituting the given value x = √17/17 into 1 - x to get the numerical result and rounding it to the hundredths place is vital. 

These sections contain the core transformations and results necessary for arriving at the solution without including redundant calculations or exploratory steps that don't contribute directly to the final answer.

- Paragraph 1, Sentence 3: <keep>suppose $x=\sqrt{17}/17$. what is the value of $\frac{2}{\pi} \int_0^{+\infty} \frac{\sin ^2 t}{t^2} cos(2xt) dt$? Rounding it to the hundredths place and return the value.</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 3: <keep>First, maybe I should recall some integral formulas involving trigonometric functions.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 2: <keep>Wait, let me write down the integral again to visualize it better:</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 1: <keep>Hmm. The integrand is [sin2(t) cos(2xt)] / t2. Hmm. I wonder if there's a standard integral formula for something like this.</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 1: <keep>So, replace sin2(t) with (1 - cos(2t))/2:</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 2: <keep>Hmm, breaking it into two integrals. Let me see if these are manageable.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 1: <keep>Wait, let me step back. Let's reconsider the original integral:</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 2: <keep>Alternatively, differentiating under the integral sign.</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 1: <keep>First, maybe a substitution. Let me let s = 2t, so that t = s/2, dt = ds/2.</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 3: <keep>So, after substitution, the integral becomes ∫0^∞ [ (1 - cos(s)) cos(xs) ] / s2 ds.</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 1: <keep>But integrating by parts with dv = 1/s2 ds gives v = -1/s.</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentence 1: <keep>Compute derivative of (1 - cos(s)) cos(xs):</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 2: <keep>Note that sin(s) cos(xs) can be expressed perhaps as a sum of sines.</keep>
- Paragraph 14, Sentence 3: <keep>So the first integral is π/2.</keep>
- Paragraph 15, Sentence 1: <keep>Now the second integral: ∫0^∞ [ (1 - cos(s)) sin(xs) / s ] ds.</keep>
- Paragraph 16, Sentence 2: <keep>First integral: ∫0^∞ sin(xs)/s ds = ∫0^∞ sin(u)/u du where u = xs, so that becomes ∫0^∞ sin(u)/u du = π/2.</keep>
- Paragraph 17, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, the second part is (1/2)( π/2 - π/2 ) = (1/2)(0) = 0.</keep>
- Paragraph 18, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, the second integral becomes ∫0^∞ [ (1 - cos(s)) sin(xs)/s ] ds = π/2 - 0 = π/2.</keep>
- Paragraph 19, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, the original integral after integrating by parts gives:</keep>
- Paragraph 20, Sentence 1: <keep>Wait, perhaps a different approach. Let me refer back to some standard integrals.</keep>
- Paragraph 21, Sentence 2: <keep>Therefore, ∫0^∞ [1 - cos(at)] / t2 dt = (π/2) a.</keep>
- Paragraph 22, Sentence 1: <keep>Now, the first integral here is ∫ cos(xs)/s2 ds which, based on the prior note, doesn't directly fit the standard formula.</keep>
- Paragraph 23, Sentence 1: <keep>But if we use standard integrals, we know that ∫0^∞ [1 - cos s][1 - cos xs]/s2 ds, perhaps with another substitution.</keep>
- Paragraph 24, Sentence 1: <keep>But recall the earlier substitution: the original integral after substitution and constants was equal to (2/π) * (1/2 * 4 ... ); wait no, let me re-examine the substitution steps.</keep>
- Paragraph 25, Sentence 1: <keep>Integral becomes (2/π) * ∫0^∞ 2(1 - cos s)/s2 * cos(xs) * (ds/2)</keep>
- Paragraph 26, Sentence 1: <keep>Which, as we computed, is (2/π) * ( π/2 - xπ/2 ) = (2/π) * π/2 (1 - x ) = (2/π)*(π/2)(1 - x) = (1 - x).</keep>
- Paragraph 27, Sentence 1: <keep>Thus, substituting x = sqrt(17)/17 ≈ 0.2425, so 1 - x ≈ 0.7575. Then rounded to the hundredths place, it would be approximately 0.76.</keep>
- Paragraph 28, Sentence 1: <keep>But given that for x=0, the answer is 1, and when x increases, the answer decreases as (1 - x).</keep>
- Paragraph 29, Sentence 1: <keep>Hence, the value rounded to hundredths is 0.76. Therefore, the final answer should be 0.76.</keep>
- Paragraph 30, Sentence 1: <keep>**Final Answer**
The value is \boxed{0.76}.</keep>
