Okay, let's figure out how to mark the essential tokens for future reasoning steps in this problem. The user needs to evaluate the integral of {f(t)}² times sqrt(1 - t²) from 0 to 1, where f(t) is a cubic polynomial such that cos(3x) = f(cos x).

First, the key step is finding f(t). The triple angle formula gives cos(3x) = 4cos³x - 3cosx, so f(t) = 4t³ - 3t. This identification is crucial because the entire integral depends on knowing f(t). So the explanation where they derive f(t) is essential.

Next, squaring f(t) gives 16t⁶ -24t⁴ +9t². The integral then splits into three terms, each involving t raised to even powers multiplied by sqrt(1-t²). The strategy here uses substitution t = sinθ to transform the integral into trigonometric form, which relates to Beta functions. This substitution method and the connection to Beta/Gamma functions are critical steps for evaluating the integral.

The calculations for each integral term (16 times t⁶, -24 times t⁴, and 9 times t²) involve applying the Beta function formula. The detailed computation of each Beta function using Gamma functions and the step-by-step reduction are essential because they show how each term contributes to the final result. For example, computing Γ(7/2), Γ(3/2), and their product for the t⁶ term demonstrates the method applied consistently across all terms.

Finally, summing the results of the three integrals gives π/8. This summation step is necessary to confirm the final answer, as omitting any term would lead to an incorrect result. Ensuring the arithmetic is correct when combining the terms is also vital.

The crucial parts here are the identification of f(t), the expansion of {f(t)}², the substitution method, the application of Beta/Gamma functions for each integral term, and the final summation. These steps form the backbone of the reasoning process.
