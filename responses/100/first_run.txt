Okay, I need to figure out which parts of the reasoning are essential for solving the problem. The key steps involve setting up the coordinate system, deriving the equations for the lines AD and BC, calculating the distances from point P to these lines, and setting them equal to find AP. The critical insight was recognizing that the distances could be related to the known side lengths (70 and 50) through their Pythagorean relationships, leading to a linear equation for p.

First, the setup with coordinates is crucial. The trapezoid's vertices are placed in a coordinate system, which allows for the application of distance formulas. The equations for lines AD and BC are derived next, which are necessary to compute the distances from point P to these lines.

The distance formulas using the point-to-line distance method are essential. The user correctly uses these formulas and simplifies them using the known lengths of AD and BC. This substitution avoids dealing with the messy calculations of h, x, and y directly, which is a key step in simplifying the problem.

The equation derived from equating the distances is pivotal. Here, substituting the known values (sqrt(h² + x²) = 70 and sqrt(h² + y²) = 50) directly leads to a linear equation in p, making the solution straightforward. This step eliminates the need to solve for h, x, or y explicitly, which would complicate the problem.

Finally, solving the linear equation gives the value of AP, and confirming that 161 and 3 are coprime ensures the correct fraction form. The final answer depends on these algebraic manipulations and substitutions, which are the backbone of the solution.

I should look for sections where these critical equations and substitutions are made. The coordinate setup, equations for lines AD and BC, distance calculations, substitution using side lengths, and the final linear equation solving for p are all essential. Each of these steps must be marked as kept to ensure the reasoning can be followed without unnecessary details.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 4: <keep>with AB=92, BC=50, CD=19, and AD=70. So it's an isosceles trapezoid? Wait, not necessarily. Because the sides BC and AD have different lengths (50 vs 70), so it's not symmetric. Hmm.</keep>

- Paragraph 4, Sentence 2: <keep>Let’s set point A at (0,0). AB is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (92,0). Then the height of the trapezoid is h.</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 1: <keep>From AD: x^2 + h^2 =70^2 => x = sqrt(4900 -h^2)</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 2: <keep>From BC: y^2 + h^2=50^2 => y= sqrt(2500 -h^2)</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 3: <keep>And since x + y=73, so sqrt(4900 - h^2) + sqrt(2500 -h^2) =73</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 4: <keep>This seems challenging, but let's let u = sqrt(4900 - h^2) and v = sqrt(2500 -h^2), so u + v=73, and u^2 -v^2=2400</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 5: <keep>But u^2 -v^2= (u -v)(u +v)= (u -v)73=2400, so u -v=2400/73.</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 6: <keep>So we have u + v=73 and u -v=2400/73≈32.8767</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 7: <keep>Adding: 2u =73 +2400/73</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, the equation of the line through AD is y = (h/x) X.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 2: <keep>Similarly, the equation of BC is Y = (-h/y)(X -92)</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 1: <keep>The center P is at (p,0) on AB. The circle centered there is tangent to both AD and BC. The distance from P to each of these lines must be equal to the radius r.</keep>

- Paragraph 7, Sentence 4: <keep>equating: h p / sqrt(h2 +x2 ) = h (92 - p ) / sqrt( h2 + y2 )</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 5: <keep>Cancel h on both sides: p / sqrt(h2 + x2 ) = (92 -p ) / sqrt( h2 + y2 )</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 6: <keep>Cross-multiplying: p * sqrt( h2 + y2 ) = (92 - p) * sqrt( h2 +x2 )</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 7: <keep>But from earlier, we have x2 + h2 =4900 and y2 + h2=2500. That is: sqrt( h2 +x2 )=70 (since x2 +h2=4900=702 ) Similarly, sqrt( h2 +y2 )=50</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 8: <keep>Therefore, our equation simplifies to: p2 *2500 = (92 -p)2 *4900</keep>

- Paragraph 7, Sentence 13: <keep>p=644/12=161/3</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 1: <keep>But in our problem statement, AP is the distance from A to P, which is p itself. So AP=161/3.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 2: <keep>But 161 and 3 are coprime? 161 is 7*23, and 3 is prime, so yes. Therefore m=161, n=3, so m+n=164.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 3: <keep>Hence, the answer is 164.</keep>
