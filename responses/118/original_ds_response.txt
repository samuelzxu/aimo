Okay, so I need to find how many positive integers have exactly three proper divisors, and each of those divisors must be less than 50. Alright, let's start by recalling what a proper divisor is. A proper divisor of a number is a positive integer that divides that number without leaving a remainder, but it's not the number itself. So, for example, the proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3.

The problem says we need numbers with exactly three proper divisors. That means the number itself must have four divisors in total because the proper divisors plus the number itself give the total number of divisors. Wait, but hold on, the problem mentions "positive integers have exactly three proper divisors", so excluding the number itself, there are three. So total number of divisors would be four. Therefore, we need numbers with exactly four divisors in total.

Now, numbers that have exactly four divisors are either of the form \( p^3 \) or \( pq \), where p and q are distinct prime numbers. This is because of the formula for the number of divisors: if a number n has the prime factorization \( n = p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}...p_k^{e_k} \), then the number of divisors is \( (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1)...(e_k + 1) \). So if the number of divisors is 4, the product must be 4, which can happen either if the number is the cube of a prime (so \( e_1 = 3 \), leading to 3+1=4 divisors), or the product of two distinct primes (each exponent is 1, leading to (1+1)(1+1)=4 divisors).

Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. The number is \( p^3 \), where p is prime.
2. The number is \( p \times q \), where p and q are distinct primes.

But we need to ensure that all proper divisors (which, in these cases, would be different for each form) are less than 50. Let's handle each case separately.

**Case 1: Numbers of the form \( p^3 \).**

The proper divisors of \( p^3 \) are 1, p, and \( p^2 \). All of these need to be less than 50. Therefore:

- \( p^2 < 50 \). Since \( p \) is prime, let's find primes p where \( p^2 < 50 \).

The primes p where \( p^2 < 50 \) would be:

Check primes starting from 2:

- 2: \( 2^2 = 4 < 50 \). Okay.
- 3: 9 < 50. Okay.
- 5: 25 < 50. Okay.
- 7: 49 < 50. Okay.
- 11: 121 >= 50. Too big.

Therefore, primes p where p <= 7, as 7^2 is 49, which is <50, but 11^2 is 121, which is over. Wait, but p itself must be prime. Wait, the primes below this sqrt(50) which is approximately 7.07. So primes less than or equal to 7. We can list them: 2, 3, 5, 7. These are the primes where \( p^3 \) would have all their proper divisors (1, p, \( p^2 \)) less than 50.

Wait, but for each \( p^3 \), we need to check that each of the proper divisors (1, p, \( p^2 \)) are less than 50. So \( p^2 < 50 \). Since \( p^3 \) doesn't have to be less than 50, right? The number itself can be greater than 50, but its proper divisors (other than itself) must all be less than 50.

So in this case, the number \( p^3 \) must be such that 1, p, \( p^2 \) are all less than 50. Since the largest proper divisor is \( p^2 \), we need \( p^2 < 50 \). As p is prime. Therefore, primes p with \( p^2 < 50 \) are 2, 3, 5, 7 as:

- 2: 4 < 50
- 3: 9 <50
- 5:25 <50
-7:49 <50

11 is next prime, 11^2=121 >=50, so they are out. So these primes 2,3,5,7 for case 1. Therefore numbers here would be 8 (2^3), 27 (3^3), 125 (5^3), 343 (7^3). Now, 125 and 343 themselves are greater than 50, but their proper divisors are less than 50. Wait, 125 has proper divisors 1,5,25; all <50. 343 has 1,7,49; 49 is <50. So all proper divisors are under 50. Hence, these are valid. So numbers here: 8,27,125,343. Total 4 numbers in this case.

**Case 2: Numbers of the form \( p \times q \), where p and q are distinct primes.**

Here, the proper divisors are 1, p, q. So all of these need to be less than 50. So p and q being primes less than 50, right? Wait, but the proper divisors are 1, p, q. So each prime factor must be less than 50 because they themselves are proper divisors. But we also need to check that their product \( p \times q \) is such that all proper divisors (which are 1, p, q) are less than 50. Wait, but 1 is always less than 50. So primes p and q need to each be less than 50, right? Because they are proper divisors of the number \( p \times q \). Therefore, primes p and q must be less than 50, but in this case, to be precise, we need the primes to be less than 50 because the divisors are the primes themselves.

Moreover, we must ensure that the number \( p \times q \) does not have any other proper divisors besides 1, p, q. But since p and q are distinct primes, their product will have exactly those divisors: 1, p, q, pq, so total four divisors. Therefore, the number \( p \times q \) will have three proper divisors: 1, p, q. So to ensure all these are less than 50, since 1 is less than 50 automatically, we just need to have p and q are primes less than 50. Wait, but the problem didn't specify whether the integer itself (i.e., pq) has to be at least, say, 50. Well, pq only needs to have its proper divisors each less than 50. Since p and q are primes less than 50, and the number itself is pq, so the number can be as small as 2*3=6, up to 47*43=2021, but whatever. The point is, pq can be any product of two distinct primes each less than 50. However, even though the primes are less than 50, if their product is, say, greater than 50, then the number itself is greater than 50 but okay because the proper divisors (the primes) need to be less than 50.

So first, primes less than 50:

Let me list them out. The primes less than 50 are:

2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47. Let's check there's 15 primes here. Let me verify quickly:

From 2 up, primes:

2. Yes.
3. Yes.
5. Yes.
7. Yes.
11.
13.
17.
19.
23.
29.
31.
37.
41.
43.
47.

47 is the last prime below 50. Next prime is 53, which is above 50. So yes, 15 primes.

So, since the numbers we are looking for are products of two distinct primes from this list, i.e., two distinct primes less than 50. Now, the count of such numbers would be the combination C(15, 2) = 15*14 / 2 = 105. But wait, but the problem requires that all proper divisors be less than 50. Wait, in this case, the proper divisors are 1, p, q. Since p and q are primes less than 50, as per above, therefore their proper divisors, which are p and q (both primes), are indeed each less than 50. So all such pq would satisfy the condition.

But hold on. Wait, the number itself is pq. So the number itself (pq) here can exceed 50, but as long as the divisors p and q are each under 50, then it's alright because we don't care about the number itself. The problem says nothing about the number being less than 50.

But hang on, is there a case where a proper divisor (other than the number itself) can be greater than or equal to 50? Wait, the only proper divisors here are 1, p, q. Since p and q are primes less than 50, their values are under 50, so 1 is under 50. Therefore, all proper divisors here are automatically under 50. Therefore, every product of two distinct primes from the list of primes under 50 would qualify. Therefore, the total number in this case is C(15,2)=105.

But wait, hold on. There might be another consideration. If p or q is equal to 1, but 1 is not prime, so all primes are 2 and above. Therefore, both p and q are primes >=2.

But actually, is there a case where pq is such that when generating the number, other divisors (non-proper) can be excluded? Wait, no, the number in question here is the product of two primes, which as aforementioned must have exactly three proper divisors: 1, p, q. Since they are co-prime and both prime. So their only divisors are those, so all proper divisors are accounted for.

Therefore, in Case 2, numbers formed by multiplying two distinct primes less than 50. The count is C(15,2)=105.

Therefore, combined with Case 1, which gives us 4 numbers, total numbers would be 105+4=109.

But wait, hold on, before I rush to that conclusion, I need to ensure that in both cases, the numbers (which could be the same?) are distinct.

Wait, can a number be both a cube of a prime and the product of two distinct primes? Well, primes cubed would be like 8=2^3 versus 2*4=8, but 4 is not prime. So in reality, numbers like 8 can't be written as pq. Similarly 27=3^3 cannot be written as pq with p and q distinct primes since it's a cube. 125=5^3 and 343=7^3 are primes cubed, so they aren't expressible as pq either, as trying to write them would require one of the primes to be 5, for example 5*25=125, but 25 is not prime. So they cannot be represented as pq with distinct primes. Therefore, these numbers are distinct. So no overlap. Therefore, total numbers would indeed be 105 + 4 = 109.

But Wait.

Wait another thing, could pq be the same as r^3 for some different prime r? That is, is  p*q = r^3? But since the left-hand side is a product of two distinct primes, and the right-hand side is a cube of a prime. The prime factorization is unique. So p*q is two primes, r^3 is one prime to the third power. Therefore, they can't be equal. So uniqueness of prime factorization does not allow for that. Therefore, two different cases. So they don't overlap.

Therefore, the answer should be 4 + 105 = 109.

But let me double-check my reasoning because I feel a bit skeptical. Let's check with specific numbers.

For example, in case 1, numbers like 8=2^3, divisors 1,2,4,8. Proper divisors:1,2,4. all <50. 27=3^3. proper divisors:1,3,9 ~ <50. 125=5^3:1,5,25 <50. 343=7^3:1,7,49 <50. Correct.

Case 2: pq with p and q primes less than 50, distinct. But those numbers, their divisors are 1,p,q,pq. All of them except pq as the number itself. So the proper divisors 1, p, q: all less than 50, as per the primes being <50. Therefore, their products may be however large â€“ could be 47*43=2021, which is a number with proper divisors 1,43,47, which are all less than 50 and pq has only three proper divisors required. So since pq doesn't have a limit on its magnitude, other than the primes themselves need to be under 50. Therefore, indeed 15 primes, combinations C(15,2)=105.

Hence adding Case1's contribution (4), the total is 105 +4=109.

But wait, let me check the problem again. Was there any other conditions? The problem says "positive integers have exactly three proper divisors (positive integral divisors excluding itself), each of which is less than 50".

Therefore, the key is, the total numbers here must have three proper divisors, each satisfying the less than 50 condition. So, both numbers as cubes of primes (p^3), which have 1,p,p^2 and p primes: in Case1, we limit p^2 <50 so that's primes up to p=7.

But in case2, pq, any two distinct primes less than 50. Because regardless of how big pq is, its proper divisors (only 1,p,q) are under 50. So even such pq numbers can be massive, with p and q primes close to 50, the product would be like 43*47=2021, but 2021's proper divisors are 1,43,47 â€“ all less than 50. Regardless, those are okay. So then 105 is correct?

Wait, but in that case, does that mean that pq's products, even as large as 43*47=2021, qualify here. So the number 2021 would satisfy: it has exactly three proper divisors (1, 43,47), each of which is <50, correct. So the number 2021 is in the set, even though it is very large. So the answer is, yes, 105.

But how many primes are less than 50? As listed above, there are 15 primes. To confirm another way, count them again:

Primes less than 50:

2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47.

Count them: 2(1),3(2),5(3),7(4),11(5),13(6),17(7),19(8),23(9),29(10),31(11),37(12),41(13),43(14),47(15). Yep 15 primes.

So combinations, when taken two at a time: C(15,2) is indeed 15*14/2=105. Correct.

Therefore, combining the two cases produces 105 +4=109 numbers.

Thus, the answer is 109. Therefore, boxed \boxed{109}.

But now, let me check this again. Wait, perhaps when both primes p and q are >= some number, but since the numbers in case2 can be large, it's okay. But perhaps one doubt is: when we take a prime p <50 and multiply it with another prime q <50, the number pq will have three proper divisors 1,p,q, each of which is less than 50 as primes involved are. So regardless of how big pq is, this counts. So if a number is allowed to be as big as that, e.g., 47*43=2021, but it's acceptable. So yes, all products are acceptable here unless... Wait, another thought. Is there a case when the number is, say, a square of a prime? For instance p=2, then p^2=4, but 4 is not in the form pq, right? But again, in our first case,  we considered cubes of primes where we had the proper divisors 1, p, p^2, but 4 is a square, the proper divisors are 1,2, which is two. So numbers of the form p^2 is only two proper divisors. So that's excluded. Similarly, numbers of the form p^4 would have 1,p,p^2,p^3. But to have three proper divisors? Wait, the total divisors would be 5, which is four plus itself. Wait, perhaps not. Wait: a number like p^4 would have 1,p,p^2,p^3,p^4, so five divisors. Therefore, proper divisors are four. But we need numbers with three proper divisors, so case1: cube primes (divisors four total, i.e., three proper) and case2: pq.

So I think the earlier reasoning holds. Let me test another small prime. For example, prime=2. Then 2^3=8, proper divisors:1,2,4 which are all <50. So okay.

Another number: say, taking p=47 and q=43, a number like:47*43=2021. Only proper divisors are 1,47,43, which are all <50. So correct. So this seems to check out.

Therefore, conclusion: 105 numbers in Case2, 4 numbers in Case1, total 109. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{109} numbers.

Just to be super thorough, perhaps the problem has a detail that "positive integers" which can be of any size, but as long as their proper divisors are each less than 50. So, even if pq is greater than 50, as in case of 47*43, so yeah, even those are counted, as long as p and q are under 50. So, correct.

Alternatively, if pq is greater than 50, maybe some thought slips in, but in this case, since the requirement is only on the proper divisor to be each less than 50 even if the number is itself arbitrary. So if p and q are less than 50 primes, and so is the number pq, why, even if pq is over 50, the fact that p and q are under 50, allows the answer.

Another check: let's think of a smaller prime combination or numbers.

E.g., take p=2 and q=3. Then you get 6, with proper divisors:1,2,3. All <<50. So counts. Take pq=2*47=94. Proper divisors:1,2,47. 47 is <50. Correct. Therefore, 94 is included here. So as per the list of 15 primes, all combinations, even like the largest pq=47*43=2021, is correct.

Hence, both cases seem accurate, so 109 is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{109}
