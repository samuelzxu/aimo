Okay, I need to determine which parts of the reasoning are essential for future steps. Let me go through each paragraph and identify the key points.

Paragraph 1 introduces the problem: finding positive integers with exactly three proper divisors, each less than 50. This is crucial to understand the problem's requirements.

In paragraph 2, the reasoning establishes that numbers with three proper divisors have four total divisors. This leads to two forms: \( p^3 \) or \( pq \). This classification is fundamental for further analysis.

Paragraph 3 details the two cases. The structure here is vital, so marking the explanation about the forms \( p^3 \) and \( pq \) is important.

Moving to Case 1 (paragraph 4), the key part is identifying primes \( p \) where \( p^2 < 50 \). The conclusion here (primes 2, 3, 5, 7) directly impacts the count, so this needs to be kept.

In Case 2 (paragraph 6), the reasoning about primes less than 50 and their combinations is essential. The list of primes and the combination formula \( C(15,2) = 105 \) must be retained.

Paragraph 8 confirms that numbers from Case 1 and Case 2 don't overlap, ensuring the total is additive. This validation step is critical for the final count.

The final answer calculation in paragraph 9 (105 + 4 = 109) is necessary as it's the conclusion derived from the prior analysis.

Each step where specific primes are listed or formulas applied must be marked to maintain the logical flow and ensure correct future reasoning.
