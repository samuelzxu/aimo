Okay, let's go through the user's problem step by step. They want to show that the effective magnetic field in the rotating frame S' is approximately B_eff ≈ b i' under the rotating wave approximation (RWA) and find the precession frequency Ω in that frame.

First, I need to recall how transforming to a rotating frame affects magnetic fields. The effective field in the rotating frame includes adjustments due to the rotation itself. The key equation involves subtracting the rotation's contribution from the lab frame's field. If the lab frame has a static field B0 in the z-direction and an oscillating field B1 in the x-direction, moving to a frame rotating at frequency Ω about the z-axis introduces a correction term.

Breaking down the oscillating B1 field using trigonometric identities shows that it splits into two counter-rotating components. The RWA neglects the rapidly oscillating term (at 2ω when Ω = ω), leaving a static effective field in the rotating frame. This static component is along the x'-direction, leading to B_eff ≈ b i'.

Next, the precession frequency Ω in the rotating frame S' is determined by the gyromagnetic ratio γ multiplied by the magnitude of B_eff. Since B_eff is along i' with magnitude b, Ω = γ b.

Now, identifying the essential tokens for future reasoning:

- The effective field equation B_eff ≈ b i' under RWA is critical.
- The relation between precession frequency and effective field (Ω = γ b) must be retained.
- Key steps include transforming to the rotating frame, applying RWA, and the resulting components of the magnetic field.
