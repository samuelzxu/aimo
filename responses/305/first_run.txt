Alright, let's break down how I arrived at the answer step by step.

First, I visualized the square ABCD with side length 12. Knowing the diagonal AC is 12√2, and since AP > CP, point P lies closer to A. I placed the square on a coordinate system with A(0,0), B(12,0), C(12,12), and D(0,12). Point P is parameterized as (t, t) where t ranges between 6 and 12.

Next, I determined the circumcenters O₁ and O₂ for triangles ABP and CDP. For triangle ABP, the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AP intersect at O₁(6, t−6). Similarly, for triangle CDP, the circumcenter O₂ is found at (6, t+6).

With the coordinates of O₁, O₂, and P, I calculated the vectors PO₁ and PO₂. Using the dot product formula, I set up the equation for the angle between these vectors being 120 degrees. This led to solving (t−6)² = 12, giving t = 6 + 2√3.

Finally, AP was calculated as t√2, resulting in AP = √72 + √24. Summing these gives a + b = 96.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 3: <keep>First, let me recall that in a square, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other at 90 degrees.</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 4: <keep>The length of the diagonal in a square with side length s is s*sqrt(2).</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 5: <keep>So, diagonal AC here should be 12*sqrt(2).</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 6: <keep>Given that P is on AC with AP > CP, AP should be longer than half the diagonal, which is 6*sqrt(2), so AP > 6*sqrt(2) and CP < 6*sqrt(2).</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 2: <keep>Let me try that approach.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 1: <keep>Let's assign coordinates to the square.</keep>

- Paragraph 6, Sentence 4: <keep>Midpoint is (6, 0).</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 5: <keep>Since AB is horizontal, the perpendicular bisector is vertical, i.e., x = 6.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 7: <keep>The midpoint is (t/2, t/2).</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 9: <keep>Therefore, the equation of the perpendicular bisector is (y - t/2) = -1*(x - t/2).</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 11: <keep>Therefore, the circumcenter O1 is at (6, t - 6).</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 1: <keep>Similarly, need to compute circumcenter O2 for triangle CDP.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 4: <keep>Midpoint is (6,12).</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 5: <keep>Since CD is horizontal, the perpendicular bisector is vertical line x = 6.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 7: <keep>Midpoint is ((12 + t)/2, (12 + t)/2).</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 9: <keep>Then, the perpendicular bisector slope is -1.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 11: <keep>y = -x + (12 + t)</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 13: <keep>Therefore, circumcenter O2 is at (6, t + 6).</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 4: <keep>The angle at P is 120 degrees.</keep>

- Paragraph 10, Sentence 8: <keep>Thus, cos(theta) = [ (t - 6)^2 - 36 ] / ( (t - 6)^2 + 36 ) ) = -1/2</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 12: <keep>3u = 36 => u = 12</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 14: <keep>t =6 + sqrt(12) =6 + 2*sqrt(3)</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 2: <keep>AP= (6 + 2*sqrt(3)) * sqrt(2) =6*sqrt(2) + 2*sqrt(3)*sqrt(2)=6*sqrt(2) + 2*sqrt(6)</keep>
