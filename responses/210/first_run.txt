Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. First, I need to understand the given recurrence relation for the sequence \( a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots \). The problem says that \( a_0 = 1 \) and for \( n \geq 1 \), the sequence is defined with a case for odd and even \( n \).

<keep>
Specifically, the recurrence is:
- If \( n \) is odd, then \( a_n = a_{n-1}a_0 + a_{n-3}a_2 + \cdots + a_0 a_{n-1} \)
- If \( n \) is even, then \( a_n = a_{n-1}a_1 + a_{n-3}a_3 + \cdots + a_1 a_{n-1} \)
</keep>

<keep>
Letâ€™s compute the first few terms manually to see the pattern. We have \( a_0 = 1 \).

For \( n = 1 \) (odd): \( a_1 = a_0 a_0 = 1 * 1 = 1 \)

For \( n = 2 \) (even): \( a_2 = a_1 a_1 = 1 * 1 = 1 \)

For \( n = 3 \) (odd): \( a_3 = a_2 a_0 + a_0 a_2 = 1*1 + 1*1 = 2 \)

For \( n = 4 \) (even): \( a_4 = a_3 a_1 + a_1 a_3 = 2*1 + 1*2 = 4 \)
</keep>

<keep>
Thus, the general formula could be written as:

For odd \( n = 2m + 1 \):
\[
a_{2m+1} = \sum_{i=0}^m a_{2i} a_{2(m - i)}
\]

For even \( n = 2m \):
\[
a_{2m} = \sum_{i=0}^{m - 1} a_{2i + 1} a_{2(m - i) - 1}
\]

The problem states that the generating function \( A(r) = a_0 + a_1 r + a_2 r^2 + a_3 r^3 + \cdots = \frac{5}{4} \). To find \( r \), we split the generating function into even and odd parts: \( A_e(r) \) and \( A_o(r) \).
</keep>

<keep>
We derive the system of equations:
1. \( A_e(r) = 1 + (A_o(r))^2 \)
2. \( A_o(r) = r \cdot (A_e(r))^2 \)
</keep>

<keep>
Substituting \( A_o(r) = r (A_e(r))^2 \) into \( A_e(r) \) gives:
\( A_e(r) = 1 + r^2 (A_e(r))^4 \)
</keep>

<keep>
Setting \( x = A_e(r) \), we solve:
\( x = 1 + r^2 x^4 \) and \( x + r x^2 = \frac{5}{4} \)
</keep>

<keep>
Substituting \( r = \frac{5/4 - x}{x^2} \) into \( x = 1 + r^2 x^4 \) leads to a quadratic equation in \( x \):
\( 16x^2 - 56x + 41 = 0 \)
</keep>

<keep>
Solving for \( x \) gives roots \( x = \frac{7 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{4} \). The valid root is \( x = \frac{7 - 2\sqrt{2}}{4} \).
</keep>

<keep>
Substituting back to find \( r \):
\( r = \frac{\sqrt{2} - 1}{2} \cdot \frac{16}{57 - 28\sqrt{2}} \)
</keep>

<keep>
Rationalizing the denominator:
\( r = \frac{8(29\sqrt{2} - 1)}{1681} \)
</keep>

<keep>
This simplifies to \( r = \frac{232\sqrt{2} - 8}{1681} \), where \( a = 232 \), \( b = 2 \), \( c = 8 \), \( d = 1681 \).
</keep>

<keep>
Summing \( a + b + c + d \) gives \( 232 + 2 + 8 + 1681 = 1923 \).

To solve the problem, we need to determine the value of \( r \) such that the generating function of the sequence converges to \(\frac{5}{4}\). The sequence is defined by a recurrence relation that depends on whether the index \( n \) is odd or even. By splitting the generating function into even and odd parts, we derive a system of equations:

1. \( A_e(r) = 1 + (A_o(r))^2 \)
2. \( A_o(r) = r \cdot (A_e(r))^2 \)

Substituting \( A_o(r) = r (A_e(r))^2 \) into the first equation gives a quartic equation in \( A_e(r) \). Solving this equation, we find the valid root \( A_e(r) = \frac{7 - 2\sqrt{2}}{4} \). Using this, we substitute back to find \( r \):

\[
r = \frac{\sqrt{2} - 1}{2} \cdot \frac{16}{57 - 28\sqrt{2}}
\]

Rationalizing the denominator and simplifying, we find \( r \) in the form \(\frac{232\sqrt{2} - 8}{1681}\). This gives the values \( a = 232 \), \( b = 2 \), \( c = 8 \), and \( d = 1681 \). Summing these values gives the result:

\[
a + b + c + d = 232 + 2 + 8 + 1681 = 1923
\]

\[
\boxed{1923}
\]
