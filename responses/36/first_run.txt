Okay, so I need to figure out which parts of the existing reasoning are essential to keep for future steps. Let's go through each paragraph step by step.

Starting with the first paragraph, they assign coordinates to the cube and set A as the origin. The coordinates of B, C, D, and G are defined in terms of the edge length 's'. This seems critical because setting up the coordinate system is foundational for all subsequent equations.

In the next few paragraphs, they write the distance equations for points B, C, D, and G. These equations are squared to remove the square roots, leading to four key equations. These equations (1) to (4) are crucial as they form the system that needs to be solved.

Then, subtracting equations to find relationships between x, y, z, and s yields equations (a), (b), and (c). These express y and z in terms of x and s, which is vital for reducing variables.

Expressing y and z in terms of x and s (y = x + 9000/s, z = x + 3600/s) is fundamental. This allows substitution into other equations, so marking these expressions is important.

Handling equation (4) by substituting x, y, z in terms of s and simplifying leads to an equation involving s² and sx. Deriving equation (d) (s² - 2sx = -864) is pivotal because it connects s and x directly.

Solving for x in terms of s from equation (d) gives x = (s² + 864)/(2s), which is necessary for expressing y and z in terms of s. Similarly, substituting into y and z expressions builds the complete relationships between coordinates and s.

Substituting these expressions back into the distance equations to compute x² + y² + z² (denoted as S) and equating it to 36,864 is the breakthrough. This leads directly to the solution AP = 192, making this derivation essential.

Finally, confirming that S = 36,864 regardless of s and calculating the square root to find AP wraps up the solution. These final steps validate the answer and should be kept.

Key points to mark include the coordinate setup, the distance equations, the subtracted equations (a), (b), (c), expressions of y and z in terms of x and s, equation (d), x expressed in terms of s, substitution into equation (4), the critical computation of S, and the final answer.
