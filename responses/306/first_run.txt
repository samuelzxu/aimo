Okay, so I need to figure out which parts of the reasoning are essential to keep for future steps. Let's look through the Deepseek Thinking Trajectory step by step.

First, the problem is solving the equation tan7x - sin6x = cos4x - cot7x. The initial steps involve rewriting the equation and combining tan7x and cot7x, which simplifies to 1/(sin7x cos7x). This part seems critical because it transforms the original equation into a simpler form.

The user then uses trigonometric identities to express sin7x cos7x as (1/2) sin14x, leading to the term 2/sin14x. This step is important because it further simplifies the equation to 2/sin14x = sin6x + cos4x. 

Next, the thought process converts the right-hand side using sum-to-product identities. This conversion results in expressions involving sin(x + π/4) and cos(5x - π/4). These transformations are crucial for rearranging the equation into a manageable form.

The user then considers product-to-sum identities again on the right-hand side, breaking down sin6x sin14x and cos4x sin14x. This step leads to combining terms into cos8x - cos20x + sin10x + sin18x = 4. Analyzing the maximum values of these terms is essential, as it leads to the conclusion that each part must reach its maximum value of 2.

Here, identifying that cos8x must be 1, cos20x must be -1, sin10x and sin18x must each be 1 is key. These conditions set up the equations to solve for x. The solutions found are x = π/4 and 5π/4 after checking domain validity and ensuring the original equation holds.

The critical steps include combining reciprocal trigonometric functions, applying trigonometric identities to simplify, analyzing maximum values, solving for x under those maximum conditions, and verifying solutions in the original equation. These parts are necessary for the logical flow leading to the final answer.
