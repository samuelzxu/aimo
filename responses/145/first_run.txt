Alright, I need to figure out which parts of the reasoning are essential for future steps. The problem involves maximizing the distance between two complex numbers and then finding c + d for z⁴. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Expressing z in polar form**: This is crucial because dealing with magnitudes and angles simplifies exponentiation. The key points are |z| = 5 and θ in (0, π).
   
   Paragraph 2, Sentence 2: <keep>Since \( |z| = 5 \), it might be easier to represent \( z \) in polar form. Let’s set \( z = 5e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). Also, since the imaginary part of \( z \) is positive (\( b > 0 \)), \( \theta \) must be in the interval \( (0, \pi) \).</keep>

2. **Expressing \( z^3 \) and \( z^5 \)**: Converting these to polar form is necessary for the distance calculation.
   
   Paragraph 3, Sentences 1-3: <keep>If \( z = 5e^{i\theta} \), then \( z^n = 5^n e^{i n \theta} \). So specifically,
   - \( z^3 = 5^3 e^{i 3\theta} = 125 e^{i 3\theta} \),
   - \( z^5 = 5^5 e^{i 5\theta} = 3125 e^{i 5\theta} \).</keep>

3. **Multiplying \( (1 + 2i)z^3 \)**: Converting 1+2i to polar form helps in multiplying with z³.
   
   Paragraph 4, Sentences 1-3: <keep>Let me convert \( 1 + 2i \) into polar form to make multiplication easier.
   - The magnitude of \( 1 + 2i \) is \( \sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{5} \).
   - The argument \( \phi = \arctan(2/1) = \arctan(2) \). So \( 1 + 2i = \sqrt{5} e^{i \phi} \), where \( \phi = \arctan(2) \).</keep>

4. **Simplifying the distance expression**: Factoring out terms and using trigonometric identities reduces complexity.
   
   Paragraph 6, Sentence 1: <keep>Let me factor out 125 from both terms:
   \[
   125 \left| \sqrt{5} e^{i (3\theta + \phi)} - 25 e^{i 5\theta} \right|
   \]</keep>

5. **Maximizing the expression**: Determining when the cosine term is minimized is critical for finding the maximum distance.
   
   Paragraph 10, Sentences 3-4: <keep>Therefore, the maximum occurs when \( \cos(2\theta - \phi) \) is minimized, i.e., \( \cos(2\theta - \phi) = -1 \). Therefore, the condition for \( \theta \) when this occurs is \( 2\theta - \phi = \pi + 2k\pi \) for integer \( k \).</keep>

6. **Solving for θ**: The angle θ is derived from the condition above.
   
   Paragraph 11, Sentence 1: <keep>Solving for \( \theta \) gives \( 2\theta = \pi + \arctan(2) + 2k\pi \). But \( \theta \) is between \( 0 \) and \( \pi \), so we can ignore higher \( k \). Let's take \( k=0 \): \( 2\theta = \pi + \arctan(2) \), so \( \theta = (\pi + \arctan(2))/2 \).</keep>

7. **Calculating z⁴**: Using θ to find z⁴'s components.
   
   Paragraph 14, Sentences 3-5: <keep>Through trig identities, found that \( \cos(4\theta) = -3/5 \), \( \sin(4\theta) = 4/5 \).
   Therefore, \( z^4 = 625*(-3/5 + 4/5i) \), giving real part \( -375 \) and imaginary part \( 500 \), summing to \( 125 \).</keep>

Each of these steps is essential for the final answer. The trigonometric simplifications and angle calculations are particularly crucial as they directly lead to the final values of c and d.
