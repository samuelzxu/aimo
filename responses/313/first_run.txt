Okay, let's break this down. The problem involves a bee making a series of movements, each time changing direction by 30 degrees counterclockwise and increasing the distance by 1 inch each step. The goal is to find the distance from the starting point P0 after 2015 such moves.

First, the key points identified are:

1. **Movement Pattern**: Each step j involves moving (j+1) inches at an angle of 30j degrees from the east. This forms a spiral-like path.
2. **Complex Plane Representation**: Using complex numbers to model each movement. Each step can be represented as a vector in the complex plane, with magnitude (j+1) and angle π/6 * j radians.
3. **Summing the Series**: The total displacement is the sum of all these vectors from j=0 to j=2014. This sum can be approached using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic-geometric series.
4. **Simplifying the Sum**: By recognizing periodicity in the angles (every 12 steps), we simplify the exponents, leading to the use of complex conjugate and modulus calculations.
5. **Final Calculation**: The modulus of the complex sum gives the distance, resulting in 1008(√6 + √2) inches.

The essential tokens here are the mathematical expressions and steps that lead to the final formula. Key steps include converting angles to radians, using Euler's formula, applying the sum formula for arithmetic-geometric series, simplifying using periodicity, and rationalizing the denominator. These steps are crucial as they form the backbone of the derivation without which the final answer can't be reached.
