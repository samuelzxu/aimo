Alright, let's start by breaking down the problem. The question involves a grid where each point (x, y) is labeled with a nonnegative integer. The starting point (0,0) is labeled 0, and for any x and y, the labels on the points (x, y), (x, y+1), and (x+1, y) must form a set of three consecutive integers {n, n+1, n+2}. We need to determine the possible labels for the point (2000, 2024).

First, I considered the initial conditions. Since (0,0) is 0, the adjacent points (0,1) and (1,0) must be labeled 1 and 2 in some order. This led me to explore two scenarios: one where (0,1)=1 and (1,0)=2, and another where (0,1)=2 and (1,0)=1.

Examining the first scenario, (0,1)=1 and (1,0)=2, I checked the next set of points. For the L-shape at (0,1), the labels (0,1)=1, (0,2), and (1,1) must form consecutive numbers. The possible sets here are {0,1,2} or {1,2,3}. However, using {0,1,2} would imply (1,1)=2, leading to a conflict with (1,0)=2. Therefore, {1,2,3} becomes the valid set, suggesting (0,2)=2 and (1,1)=3.

Moving to the L-shape at (1,0)=2, the labels (1,0)=2, (1,1)=3, and (2,0) must form consecutive integers. Here, the set {2,3,4} fits, making (2,0)=4. This pattern suggests that moving right increases the label by 2 each time, and moving up increases it by 1, leading to the formula f(x, y) = 2x + y.

For the second scenario where (0,1)=2 and (1,0)=1, a similar analysis shows that moving up increases by 2 and moving right by 1, leading to the formula f(x, y) = x + 2y.

By verifying these linear functions against the problem's conditions, I confirmed that both formulas satisfy the requirement of consecutive integers in every L-shape. Applying these formulas to the point (2000, 2024), we calculate:

1. Using f(x, y) = 2x + y: 2*2000 + 2024 = 6024
2. Using f(x, y) = x + 2y: 2000 + 2*2024 = 6048

Thus, the possible labels for (2000, 2024) are 6024 and 6048.
