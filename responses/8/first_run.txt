Alright, let's go through the problem step by step. We need to find the probability that Kathy will be happy when she lays out 5 cards from a shuffled deck of 5 red and 5 green cards. She's happy if all red cards laid out are adjacent and all green cards laid out are adjacent. 

First, the total number of possible sequences is calculated by permutations of 5 cards from 10, which is 10P5 = 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 = 30240. 

Next, we consider the happy sequences. These can be either all red, all green, or a combination where all reds and greens are in separate blocks. 

For all red or all green sequences (Case 1), there are 2 possibilities, each with 5! permutations: 2 × 120 = 240.

For combinations (Case 2), we consider sequences with k red and (5−k) green cards, which can be ordered as either red block followed by green or vice versa. For each k from 1 to 4, we calculate the permutations:
- For k=1 and k=4: 2 × (5P1 × 5P4) = 2 × (5 × 120) = 1200 each.
- For k=2 and k=3: 2 × (5P2 × 5P3) = 2 × (20 × 60) = 2400 each.

Summing these gives 1200 + 2400 + 2400 + 1200 = 7200.

Total happy sequences are 240 (Case 1) + 7200 (Case 2) = 7440.

The probability is 7440/30240, which simplifies to 31/126. The sum of m and n is 31 + 126 = 157.
