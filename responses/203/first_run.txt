Okay, let's try to figure out which parts of the reasoning are essential to keep for future steps. The main goal is to identify the key calculations and values that lead to the final answer. 

First, the problem involves two plans with different compounding frequencies and payment structures. The critical steps are calculating the total payments under each plan and finding the difference. 

For Plan 1, the essential parts are the compound interest calculations after 5 and 10 years. The formula A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) is used twice: once for the initial 5 years and again for the remaining 5 years after the payment. The values of (1.025)^20 calculated here are crucial because they determine the balance at both payment points. 

Then, the half-payment after 5 years and the subsequent remaining balance's growth are key. The exact amounts after each compounding period need to be retained because they directly contribute to the total payment sum.

For Plan 2, the calculation is simpler but still vital. The compound interest over 10 years with annual compounding uses (1.10)^10, which is a known value. This result is necessary to compare against Plan 1's total.

Finally, the difference between the two totals must be highlighted, including the rounding step. 

I should ensure that all instances where the compound interest formula is applied, along with the intermediate results like (1.025)^20 ≈ 1.6386 and (1.10)^10 ≈ 2.5937, are marked. Also, the exact payment amounts after each period and the final totals are essential. 

I need to check that each marked section includes complete sentences or phrases from the original reasoning without altering any text. Also, since the problem requires rounding to the nearest dollar, the final difference calculation and rounding step must be included.
