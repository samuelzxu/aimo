Okay, so I need to figure out the electric potential inside and outside a sphere. Hmm, wait, the problem doesn't specify if it's a conducting sphere or an insulating one with charge distributed uniformly. That might make a difference. Let me think... The user just said "the sphere," so maybe there's some previous context? But since I'm acting as a student who just came across this problem, I need to make some assumptions. 

I remember that for a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, all the charge resides on the surface, and the electric field inside is zero. For an insulator, like a uniformly charged sphere, the charge is spread out throughout the volume, and the electric field inside varies with radius. The potential calculations would differ in each case. Maybe the problem is referring to a uniformly charged insulating sphere? That seems like a common textbook problem. Let me go with that. If that's not the case, I can adjust later.

Alright, so the sphere has radius R and total charge Q. I need to compute the potential both inside and outside. As I recall, the electric potential V(r) is related to the electric field E(r) by the integral V(r) = -∫ E · dl, usually from infinity to the point r, because potential is the work done to bring a unit charge from infinity to that point. But since electric field inside and outside the sphere are different, I'll need to handle the two regions separately.

First, let's start outside the sphere. For r > R, the sphere behaves like a point charge, right? So the electric field outside is E_out(r) = kQ / r2, pointing radially outward, where k is Coulomb's constant. Therefore, the potential outside V_out(r) would be the integral of E_out from infinity to r. Let's calculate that:

V_out(r) = -∫ (from ∞ to r) E_out(r') dr' = -∫ (from ∞ to r) (kQ / r'2) dr'

Integrating 1/r2 gives -1/r, so the integral becomes:

V_out(r) = -kQ [ -1/r' ] from ∞ to r = -kQ ( -1/r + 0 ) = kQ / r

Wait, but actually, since we are integrating from ∞ to r, let me check the limits again. If we do the integral from ∞ to r, substituting the upper limit r into -1/r' gives -1/r, and substituting ∞ gives zero. So the integral is (-kQ)( -1/r - 0 ) = kQ / r. That's correct, so the potential outside is indeed kQ/r, same as a point charge.

Now, for the region inside the sphere, r < R. The electric field inside a uniformly charged sphere is different. The charge enclosed within radius r is less than Q. Since the charge is uniformly distributed, volume charge density ρ = Q / ( (4/3)πR3 ). Then, the enclosed charge at radius r is q_enc = ρ * (4/3)πr3 = Q(r3 / R3)

Therefore, the electric field inside E_in(r) is k * q_enc / r2 = k Q r3 / (R3 r2) ) = k Q r / R3

So E_in(r) = (k Q / R3) r

Now, to find the potential inside, V_in(r), we need to integrate the electric field from infinity to r, but since the electric field is different inside and outside, we have to split the integral into two parts: from infinity to R, and then from R to r.

So V_in(r) = - ∫ (from ∞ to R) E_out(r') dr' - ∫ (from R to r) E_in(r') dr'

We already know the first integral is V_out(R) = kQ / R. The second integral is:

- ∫ (from R to r) (k Q / R3) r' dr' 

Let's compute that:

- (k Q / R3) ∫ (from R to r) r' dr' = - (k Q / R3) [ (1/2) r'2 ] from R to r

= - (k Q / R3) [ (1/2 r2 - 1/2 R2) ]

= - (k Q / R3) * (1/2)(r2 - R2)

= - (k Q / (2 R3)) (r2 - R2)

Simplify:

= (k Q / (2 R3)) (R2 - r2) )

Therefore, combining the two parts:

V_in(r) = kQ/R + (k Q / (2 R3))(R2 - r2)

Factor kQ out:

V_in(r) = (k Q / R) [1 + (1/(2 R2))(R2 - r2)]

Simplify inside the brackets:

1 + (R2 - r2)/(2 R2) = 1 + (1/2 - r2/(2 R2)) ) = 3/2 - (r2)/(2 R2)

Wait, actually, let's do that step again. Let's expand the terms:

= (k Q / R) [ 1 + ( R2/(2 R2 ) - r2/(2 R2 ) ) ]

Simplify each term inside the brackets:

R2 / (2 R2 ) is 1/2, and r2/(2 R2 ) is (r2)/(2 R2 )

Therefore:

= (k Q / R) [ 1 + 1/2 - (r2)/(2 R2 ) ] = (k Q / R) [ 3/2 - (r2)/(2 R2 ) ]

Alternatively, we can keep it as:

V_in(r) = kQ/R + (k Q)/(2 R3)(R2 - r2) = kQ/R + (k Q)/(2 R) [1 - (r2/R2) ]

Which can be written as:

V_in(r) = (k Q)/(2 R) [ 3 - (r2/R2) ]

Wait, let's check algebra again.

Original expression after computing integrals:

V_in(r) = k Q/R + (k Q / (2 R3))(R2 - r2)

Let's factor out k Q / (2 R3):

= k Q [ (1/R) + (R2 - r2)/(2 R3 ) ]

But let's convert the first term to have denominator 2 R3:

= k Q [ (2 R2)/(2 R3 ) + (R2 - r2)/(2 R3 ) ] = k Q [ (2 R2 + R2 - r2 ) / (2 R3 ) ]

Simplify numerator:

3 R2 - r2 

So:

V_in(r) = k Q (3 R2 - r2 ) / (2 R3 )

Multiply numerator and denominator:

= (k Q) / (2 R3 ) * (3 R2 - r2 )

Divide 3 R2 by 2 R3 gives 3/(2 R), and -r2/(2 R3)

Wait, not sure if this is the simplest form. Alternatively, factor 1/(2 R):

= (k Q ) / (2 R ) [ 3 - (r/R )2 ]

Yes, that's better. So:

V_in(r) = (3 k Q )/(2 R ) [ 1 - (r2)/(3 R2 ) ]?

Wait, let me check:

Wait, starting from:

Numerator: 3 R2 - r2. Denominator: 2 R3 

Therefore, (3 R2 - r2)/(2 R3) = 3/(2 R) - r2/(2 R3)

But if I want to factor 1/(2 R):

= (1/(2 R )) (3 - r2/R2 )

Yes, exactly. Therefore:

V_in(r) = (k Q )/(2 R ) (3 - r2 / R2 )

Alternatively, 3 k Q/(2 R ) - (k Q r2 )/(2 R3 )

So, inside the sphere, the potential decreases quadratically with r, starting from 3 k Q/(2 R ) at the center and matching the potential at the surface (which is k Q / R ) when r = R.

Wait, let's check: when r = R,

V_in(R) = (3 k Q)/(2 R ) - (k Q R2 )/(2 R3 ) = (3 k Q)/(2 R ) - (k Q)/(2 R ) = (2 k Q)/(2 R ) = k Q / R, which matches V_out(R). Good, continuity at the surface.

Potential is continuous everywhere, even though electric field might not be. However, electric field is also continuous here? Wait, no. Electric field outside at R is k Q / R2, and inside at R is k Q R / R3 = k Q / R2, so it is continuous here. But in the case of a conductor, the electric field would be discontinuous because the surface charge creates a discontinuity. But in this case, since it's a uniformly charged insulator, the electric field is continuous. So both E and V are continuous across the surface.

That's an important check. So in conclusion, outside V(r) = k Q / r, inside V(r) = (k Q )/(2 R ) [3 - (r2)/( R2 )]. 

Wait, just to write that more neatly:

Inside: V(r) = (kQ)/(2R) [3 - (r/R)2]

Yes, that's a standard result.

Alternatively, it can be written as:

V(r) = (3kQ)/(2R) - (kQ r2)/(2R3)

Either form is correct. But perhaps the first is more compact.

So, summarizing:

Electric potential for a uniformly charged insulating sphere:

- Outside (r ≥ R): V(r) = kQ/r

- Inside (r ≤ R): V(r) = (kQ)/(2R) [3 - (r/R)2]

I should also remember to express k as 1/(4πε0) if needed, but the problem just says "compute the electric potential", so either form is acceptable, probably. However, perhaps using ε0 is more standard. Wait, in many textbooks, they write expressions in terms of Q, R, r, and constants like 1/(4πε0). Let me confirm.

The potential outside is indeed (1/(4πε0)) Q / r, and inside is (1/(4πε0)) Q/(2R) [3 - (r/R)2]. So if I need to express in terms of ε0, I can, but if k is already defined as 1/(4πε0), then the expressions I have are okay. The problem doesn’t specify, so either way is acceptable. I think writing in terms of k is probably fine.

Wait, one more thing. The direction of integration. When computing the potential inside, why did we split the integral from ∞ to R and then R to r? Because the electric field is different in those regions. So integrating from infinity to R, using the external electric field, and from R to r using the internal electric field. Then we add both contributions. That’s crucial.

Another approach could be to compute the potential at a point inside the sphere directly by integrating the electric field from the center to the surface and then from the surface to the point. Wait, but no, because electric field is a vector, and work done against it depends on the path. Since the electric field is conservative, line integral is path independent, so integrating from infinity to the point is okay. However, since the electric field has different expressions, splitting into regions is necessary.

Alternatively, for a solid sphere, the potential can also be found by directly integrating the contributions from each infinitesimal charge element. But that’s more complicated because it involves a volume integral. However, maybe I can check both methods.

Let me recall: For a spherical charge distribution, the potential inside can be found as the sum of the potential due to the charge inside radius r and the potential due to the charge outside r. But since all charge is inside when we are in the sphere (since the whole sphere is charged). Wait, no. If I'm considering a point inside the sphere, all the charge is distributed from 0 to R. So integrating dq/r, where r is the distance from the point. Hmm, this might not split easily because for points inside the sphere, some charges are closer and some are farther. It's a more involved calculation. But maybe using Gauss's law for E first, then integrating to get V is easier.

Indeed, the method I first used is more straightforward for a student: use Gauss's law to find E in both regions, then integrate E to get V, ensuring continuity at the boundary. That gives the correct result. Let me see if my equations hold up.

For a uniformly charged sphere (insulating), the internal electric field increases linearly with r, as found above, and the potential inside is quadratic. At the center, the potential is (3/2) times the potential at the surface. For example, at r=0:

V_in(0)= (3 k Q)/(2 R )

But the potential outside at the same point (if we imagine approaching from outside) is k Q / R as r approaches R. So center has a higher potential, as expected, since electric field points outward, so moving from center to surface, potential decreases. 

Yes, that makes sense. Because positive charges would move from higher to lower potential, so if the electric field is directed outward, the potential decreases as you move outwards.

Therefore, all my calculations seem consistent. Therefore, the final expressions are:

Outside the sphere (r ≥ R):

V(r) = k Q / r

Inside the sphere (r ≤ R):

V(r) = (3 k Q)/(2 R ) - (k Q r2 )/(2 R3 )

Alternatively:

V(r) = (k Q)/(2 R ) (3 - (r2)/(R2 ) )

Either form is acceptable, but the second form might be preferable in terms of clarity.

Wait, just to make sure there are no calculation errors:

Let me rederive V_in(r).

The electric field inside is E_in(r) = (k Q r)/R3

Then, the potential inside is found by integrating E_in from r to R (since from R to infinity, it's E_out) plus the potential at R, which is k Q / R.

Wait, some people can get confused here. So the potential at a point inside is the potential at R plus the integral of E from R to r (note the direction). Wait, the potential difference between R and r is:

V(r) - V(R) = - ∫ (from R to r) E · dl.

But in this case, moving from R (higher radius) to r (lower radius), but E is directed radially outward. dl is the path element. Let's suppose we move radially inward, so dl is in the negative r direction, so dl = -dr (in the radial direction). Therefore:

V(r) - V(R) = - ∫ (from R to r) E dr' (-dr direction)

Wait, maybe I should consider direction more carefully.

The potential at a point r inside is equal to the potential at infinity minus the integral of E from infinity to r.

But to compute that, splitting the integral into two regions, infinity to R and R to r. But the integral from infinity to R is integral of E_out dr, the integral from R to r is integral of E_in dr.

Wait, but to get the potential V(r) inside, moving from infinity to R (with E_out(r) = kQ/r2) and then from R to r (with E_in(r) = kQ/R3 * r ). The integral is:

V(r) = - ∫_{∞}^R E_out(r') dr' - ∫_{R}^r E_in(r') dr'

Which is the same as:

V(r) = V_out(R) - ∫_{R}^r E_in(r') dr'

Since V_out(R) = kQ/R

Then,

V(r) = kQ/R - ∫_{R}^r (k Q/R3) r' dr'

Compute the integral:

= kQ/R - (k Q/R3) ∫_{R}^r r' dr' = kQ/R - (k Q/(2 R3)) [r'^2 ]_{R}^r

= kQ/R - (k Q/(2 R3))(r2 - R2 )

= kQ/R - (k Q/(2 R3))(r2 - R2 ) 

= kQ/R - (k Q r2) / (2 R3 ) + (k Q R2 ) / (2 R3 )

Simplify terms:

= kQ/R + (k Q )/(2 R ) - (k Q r2 )/(2 R3 )

Factor:

= (k Q)/(2 R ) [ 2 + 1 ] - (k Q r2 )/(2 R3 )

Wait, that approach might be complicating. Let's compute directly:

kQ/R + (k Q R2 )/(2 R3 ) - (k Q r2 )/(2 R3 )

= kQ/R + (k Q )/(2 R ) - (k Q r2 )/(2 R3 )

Combine the first two terms:

= (3 k Q )/(2 R ) - (k Q r2 )/(2 R3 )

Therefore:

V_in(r) = (3 k Q)/(2 R ) - (k Q r2 )/(2 R3 )

Or:

V_in(r) = (k Q)/(2 R3 ) (3 R2 - r2 )

Which is equivalent.

Yes, so that's correct. So breaking down the calculation step-by-step again, made me confirm that the expression is accurate.

Therefore, I'm confident with these results.

**Final Answer**

The electric potential inside the sphere is \boxed{\frac{kQ}{2R} \left( 3 - \frac{r^2}{R^2} \right)} and outside the sphere is \boxed{\frac{kQ}{r}}.
