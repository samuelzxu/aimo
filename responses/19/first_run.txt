Okay, I need to determine which parts of the reasoning process are essential to retain for future steps. Let's go through the thinking trajectory step by step.

First, the problem involves finding positive integers \( n \) such that the sum of cubes up to \( n \) divided by \( n + 5 \) leaves a remainder of 17. The key formula here is the sum of cubes: \( \left( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \right)^2 \). This formula is crucial because it transforms the problem into a modular arithmetic equation.

Next, the substitution \( k = n + 5 \) is introduced to simplify the modulus. This substitution is vital as it rephrases the problem in terms of \( k \), turning the original equation into a congruence modulo \( k \). The transformation \( n = k - 5 \) must be retained to connect \( k \) back to \( n \).

The critical step is simplifying the expression \( \frac{(k - 5)(k - 4)}{2} \) modulo \( k \). The insight that \( (k - 5)(k - 4) \equiv 20 \mod k \) reduces the problem significantly. This simplification allows for further steps by recognizing that dividing by 2 gives \( 10 \mod k \), which leads to the equation \( 10^2 \equiv 17 \mod k \).

Solving \( 100 \equiv 17 \mod k \) results in \( k \) dividing 83. Since 83 is prime, the only valid \( k \geq 6 \) is 83, leading to \( n = 83 - 5 = 78 \). This reasoning chain is essential as it directly leads to the solution.

The verification step, where \( n = 78 \) is checked by calculating the sum modulo 83 and confirming the remainder is 17, reinforces the correctness of the solution. This confirmation is necessary to ensure no errors were made in the algebraic manipulations.

Lastly, considering other potential values for \( k \) and dismissing them due to 83's primality is important to establish that 78 is the only solution. The conclusion that the sum of all such \( n \) is 78 wraps up the problem neatly.
