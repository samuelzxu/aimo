Alright, let's break down the problem and the solution step by step to identify which tokens are essential for future reasoning steps.

First, the problem requires minimizing the expression \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} + \frac{3}{c}\) given the constraint \(21ab + 2bc + 8ca \leq 12\). The solution uses the method of Lagrange multipliers, which involves setting up the Lagrangian function and deriving partial derivatives. Key steps here include forming the Lagrangian and setting up the system of equations from the partial derivatives.

The critical part is solving the system of equations obtained from the partial derivatives. This involves expressing \(\lambda\) from each equation and equating them to find relationships between \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). Substituting \(b = ka\) and \(c = ma\) simplifies the equations, leading to expressions for \(k\) and \(m\).

The derived equations \(k^2 (21 + 2m) = 2 (21k + 8m)\) and others are essential for determining the ratios between variables. Solving these equations involves algebraic manipulation and eventually leads to a cubic equation. Identifying the valid root \(k = 12/5\) and substituting back to find \(m = 9/2\) are crucial steps.

Substituting \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in terms of a single variable \(t\) into the constraint equation allows solving for \(t\). This leads to the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), which are then used to compute the minimal value of the original expression. The verification step where the computed values satisfy the constraint is also essential for confirming the solution.

The final calculation of the expression \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} + \frac{3}{c}\) using the found values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) confirms the minimal value. Each algebraic step and substitution must be preserved to ensure the logical flow and correctness of the solution. Additionally, the consideration of alternative methods like AM-GM or Cauchy-Schwarz, although not used, provides context for the chosen approach.
