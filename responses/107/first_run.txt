Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to find the smallest square side length 'a' that can fit five disks of radius 1 without any overlapping interiors. Each disk's center must be at least 2 units apart from others. 

First, consider placing four disks at the square's corners. Their centers would be at (1,1), (1,a-1), (a-1,1), and (a-1,a-1). The fifth disk needs to be in the center (a/2, a/2). Calculating the distance from this center to any corner disk:

sqrt[(a/2 -1)^2 + (a/2 -1)^2] = sqrt(2)*(a/2 -1). This must be ≥2. Solving gives a ≥2 + 2√2.

Alternative arrangements like staggered rows or different shapes were considered but led to larger side lengths. The symmetric center placement ensures minimal distance and fits within the calculated dimensions. Confirming with known packing configurations and verifying distances, the optimal solution is indeed 2 + 2√2.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 3: <keep>Each disk has a radius of 1, so the diameter of each disk is 2.</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 4: <keep>If the disks can't have overlapping interiors, they can touch each other at the edges but can't share any inner points.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 1: <keep>First, I should recall whether there's a known arrangement of five circles in a square that's optimal.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 3: <keep>Then the fifth disk has to be placed somewhere in the center such that its center is at least 2 units away from all four corner disks.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 4: <keep>The distance from the center of the fifth disk (let's say (a/2, a/2)) to any corner disk center would be sqrt[(a/2 - 1)^2 + (a/2 - 1)^2] = sqrt{2*(a/2 -1)^2} = sqrt(2)*(a/2 -1).</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 5: <keep>sqrt(2)*(a/2 -1) ≥ 2</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 6: <keep>a/2 -1 ≥ 2 / sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 7: <keep>a ≥ 2 + 2√2 ≈ 2 + 2.828 ≈ 4.828</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 2: <keep>Alternatively, if I think of placing four circles at the corners of a square and the fifth one in the center.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 1: <keep>Suppose the square has side length 'a'.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 3: <keep>The distance from the center of the fifth disk (a/2, a/2) to any corner disk center would be sqrt[(a/2 - 1)^2 + (a/2 - 1)^2] = sqrt{2*(a/2 -1)^2} = sqrt(2)*(a/2 -1).</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 4: <keep>sqrt(2)*(a/2 -1) ≥ 2</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 5: <keep>a ≥ 2 + 2√2 ≈ 4.828</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 1: <keep>Another thought is arranging the five disks in a cross shape, maybe.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 3: <keep>The distance from the center of the big square to each outer disk center is S/√2.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 4: <keep>S/√2 ≥ 2 (distance between centers).</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 5: <keep>S ≥ 2*√2 ≈ 2.828.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 6: <keep>the big square's side is 2*( S/2 + 1 ) = S + 2.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 7: <keep>Therefore, the side length a = 2 + 2√2 ≈ 4.828.</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 1: <keep>Alternatively, arrange the centers of the five disks in a different manner.</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 1: <keep>Suppose the centers of the four outer disks be at (x, x), (x, a -x), (a -x, x), (a -x, a -x).</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 3: <keep>sqrt(2)*(a/2 -x) ≥ 2 => a/2 -x ≥ sqrt(2) => x ≤ a/2 - sqrt(2)</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 4: <keep>the outer disks are at a distance of x from the sides. Since their radius is 1, the center must be at least 1 unit from the sides. Therefore, x ≥ 1.</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 5: <keep>1 ≤ a/2 - sqrt(2) => a/2 ≥ 1 + sqrt(2) => a ≥ 2 + 2*sqrt(2)</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 1: <keep>Upon some quick research in my mind, I think the known minimal square for five unit circles is indeed 2 + 2√2.</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 3: <keep>Erich's Packing Center mentions that.</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 3: <keep>sqrt(2)*(a/2 -1) = sqrt(2)*(1 + √2 - 1) = sqrt(2)*(√2) = 2.</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 4: <keep>Therefore, the distance is exactly 2.</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 5: <keep>this is the minimal square size.</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 6: <keep>The answer is \boxed{2 + 2\sqrt{2}}.</keep>
