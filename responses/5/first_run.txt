Alright, let me go through the problem step by step. The question is about a trapezoid with bases differing by 100 units. The midline divides the trapezoid into areas with a ratio of 2:3. We need to find the length x of the segment that splits the trapezoid into equal areas and then determine the greatest integer not exceeding x²/100.

First, I need to recall the properties of trapezoids. The midline's length is the average of the two bases. Given the ratio 2:3, we can set up an equation. Let’s denote the shorter base as b and the longer one as b + 100. The midline is (b + (b + 100))/2 = b + 50. The areas divided by this midline depend on the heights. Since the height splits into two equal parts, each area is calculated based on the midline. Setting up the ratio (b + 25)/(b + 75) = 2/3, solving this gives b = 75. So, the bases are 75 and 175.

Next, finding x. The line that divides the area equally should be the root mean square (RMS) of the bases. RMS formula: √[(75² + 175²)/2] = √[(5625 + 30625)/2] = √(18125). Squaring x gives 18125, so x²/100 = 181.25. The greatest integer not exceeding this is 181. 

Now, I need to identify which parts of this reasoning are essential to keep for future steps. The key steps are setting up the ratio leading to bases 75 and 175, using RMS for x, and the final calculation. These parts should be marked with <keep> tags to ensure the necessary information is retained without extra details.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 5: <keep>The ratio of upper to lower area is (b + 25)/(b + 75) = 2/3.</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 6: <keep>Cross-multiplying: 3(b + 25) = 2(b + 75); 3b + 75 = 2b + 150; subtract 2b from both sides: b + 75 = 150; so b = 75.</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 7: <keep>Therefore, the shorter base is 75 units, longer is 175 units.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 6: <keep>So the bases are 75 and 175.</keep>
