Okay, I need to identify which parts of the existing reasoning are essential for proving that \(a_n = b_n\). Let me read through the provided thinking trajectory carefully.

The user started by understanding the problem, testing small cases (n=2, n=3, n=4), and observed that reversing the epsilon sequence gives the same result. They explored matrix representations of the recursive steps and considered the product of matrices in reverse order. Key ideas include the reversal of epsilon sequence, matrix products, and induction.

Important sections:
1. **Base cases** for n=2 and n=3 showing \(a_n = b_n\) through specific examples.
2. The **matrix representation** of each recursive step and their product for forward and reversed sequences.
3. **Inductive hypothesis** suggesting that if the result holds for smaller n, it holds for larger n.
4. **Examples** with mixed epsilon values (e.g., [0,1,0]) demonstrating the equality despite reversed operations.
5. **Algebraic expansions** and checking commutativity of operations under specific initial conditions (a0=1, a1=7).
6. **Key insights** about the reversed epsilon sequence leading to identical products or combinations due to linearity and initial conditions.

I need to mark these parts where the critical reasoning steps occur, ensuring that tokens necessary for future steps (like induction hypothesis, matrix product properties, example outcomes) are preserved.
