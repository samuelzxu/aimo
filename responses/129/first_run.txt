Okay, let's break down the problem and solution step by step to identify the essential tokens that need to be kept for future reasoning.

First, the problem setup: a tournament with N players, each playing against every other player once. Points are awarded as 1 for a win, 0.5 each for a tie. The key conditions are that half of each player's points come from games against the ten lowest-scoring players, and those ten themselves earned half their points from each other.

Critical steps in the reasoning:

1. **Total points in the tournament**: This is determined by the total number of games, which is N(N-1)/2. This total points value is crucial because it sets the overall equation.

2. **Definitions of sets S and T**: T is the ten lowest scorers, S is the rest (N-10 players). The structure of these groups and their interactions (intra-group vs. inter-group games) form the core of the equations.

3. **Points earned by T within T**: Since each of the ten in T earns half their points from intra-T games, and there are C(10,2)=45 games among them, the total points from these games are 45. This leads to P_T (total points for T) being 90, as 45 is half of P_T.

4. **Points earned by S within S**: The intra-S games contribute half of S's total points (P_S). The number of intra-S games is C(N-10,2), so the equation here links P_S to N.

5. **Inter-group games between S and T**: The total points from these games must split between S and T according to the given conditions. This leads to an equation combining P_S, P_T, and the number of inter-group games.

6. **Solving the quadratic equation**: The derived equation is (N-10)(N-11) + 90 = N(N-1)/2. Solving this gives two solutions, N=25 and N=16, but only N=25 is valid because in N=16, T would have higher average points than S, contradicting T being the lowest scorers.

Essential tokens are those that establish these key equations and the critical validation step. For example:

- The total points equation and the definitions of P_S and P_T.
- The quadratic equation and its solutions.
- The validation of N=25 based on the average points of S and T.

Each of these steps is vital for maintaining the logical flow and ensuring that the reasoning can be followed and verified. Missing any of these could lead to gaps in understanding how the answer was derived.
