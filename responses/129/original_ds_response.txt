Okay, let me try to figure out this tournament problem. So, there's a tournament where each player plays exactly one game against each other player. In each game, the winner gets 1 point, the loser 0, and if it's a tie, both get 1⁄2 point. After the tournament, they noticed that for every player, exactly half of the points they earned were earned in games against the ten players with the least number of points. Additionally, those ten lowest-scoring players each earned half of their points from playing against each other. I need to find the total number of players in the tournament. 

Hmmm. Let's start by understanding what's given. We have a tournament with N players, each plays against every other player exactly once. The scoring system is standard: 1 for a win, 0.5 for a tie, 0 for a loss. The key points here are that the top players (those not in the bottom ten) earned half their points from playing against the bottom ten, and the bottom ten earned half their points from playing against each other. 

Let me digest that again. Each player outside the bottom ten earned half their points by playing against the bottom ten. The bottom ten themselves earned half their points from their games against the other nine in the bottom ten. Let me structure this.

Let me denote:

- Let T be the set of the ten players with the least points. So |T| = 10.

- Let S be the set of the remaining players, so |S| = N - 10.

The total number of games played in the tournament is C(N, 2) = N(N - 1)/2. So total points awarded in the tournament are equal to the number of games played (since each game contributes 1 point total, whether split or awarded entirely to one player). Therefore, total points = N(N - 1)/2.

Now, according to the problem:

For each player in S, half of their points were earned from games against T. So, if a player in S scored P points total, then P/2 points came from playing against the ten in T, and P/2 came from playing against other players in S.

Similarly, each player in T earned half their points from playing against the other nine in T. So, if a player in T earned Q points total, then Q/2 came from games within T (against 9 players) and Q/2 from games against S (they played N - 10 games against S).

This seems like a system where the points earned in certain subsets have a specific ratio. Maybe working with total points for S and T would help.

Let's define:

- Total points earned by all players in S: P_S

- Total points earned by all players in T: P_T

So, P_S + P_T = total points = N(N - 1)/2.

Now, for each player in S: half their points come from T. So the total points earned by all S players against T is (1/2) P_S. Similarly, the total points earned by all S players against other S players is also (1/2) P_S.

Similarly, for each player in T: half their points are earned within T. So the total points earned by T in games among themselves is (1/2) P_T, and the points earned by T against S is (1/2) P_T.

But we need to analyze the games between S and T. 

Wait, the games between S and T: for each such game, each player is in S or T. The total points earned by S from these games is (1/2) P_S, and the total points earned by T from these games is (1/2) P_T. But this total should also equal the total points from all S vs T games, as those points are split between S and T.

Wait, in total, the number of games between S and T is 10*(N - 10). Each game contributes 1 point divided between S and T. So the total points from these inter-group games is 10*(N - 10). But these points are split such that S earned (1/2) P_S and T earned (1/2) P_T. Therefore:

(1/2) P_S + (1/2) P_T = 10*(N - 10)

Similarly, the total points earned by T in intra-T games is (1/2) P_T. But the intra-T games are the 10*9/2 = 45 games, so total points from intra-T games is 45 (since each game awards 1 point total). Therefore:

(1/2) P_T = 45. Therefore, P_T = 90.

Similarly, the points earned by S in intra-S games is (1/2) P_S. The number of intra-S games is C(N - 10, 2) = (N - 10)(N - 11)/2, so total points from intra-S games is (N - 10)(N - 11)/2. But points from intra-S games are equal to (1/2) P_S, then:

(1/2) P_S = (N - 10)(N - 11)/2

Thus, P_S = (N - 10)(N - 11)

Also, recall that P_S + P_T = N(N - 1)/2

But since P_T = 90, then:

(N - 10)(N - 11) + 90 = N(N - 1)/2

So, let's write this equation:

(n - 10)(n - 11) + 90 = n(n - 1)/2

We need to solve for N here, but the variables got changed here. Let me use n instead of N for simplicity. So:

(n - 10)(n - 11) + 90 = (n(n - 1))/2

Expand the left-hand side:

(n^2 - 21n + 110) + 90 = n(n - 1)/2

Simplify:

n^2 - 21n + 200 = (n^2 - n)/2

Multiply both sides by 2:

2n^2 - 42n + 400 = n^2 - n

Subtract n^2 - n from both sides:

n^2 - 41n + 400 = 0

Now, solve this quadratic equation:

n = [41 ± sqrt(1681 - 1600)] / 2

sqrt(81) = 9

Thus,

n = [41 ± 9]/2

Therefore,

n = 50/2 = 25 or n = (41 - 9)/2 = 32/2 = 16

But 16 is problematic. Let's check n = 25 first.

If n = 25, then S = 25 - 10 = 15, T =10.

Compute P_S = (25 - 10)(25 - 11) = 15*14 =210

P_T = 90 which we had earlier.

Total points: 210 + 90 =300

Now, check N(N - 1)/2 for N =25:25*24/2=300, which is correct.

Check if n =16 works: N=16. Then S=6, T=10.

Wait N=16 would only have 16 -10=6 players in S.

But then total points: S= (6)(5)=30 (times 1 since P_S=(n-10)(n-11)=6*5=30)

P_T=90

Total:30+90=120

Check N(N -1)/2=16*15/2=120. So, yes, equates as well.

But is N=16 possible?

Wait. Wait, if there are 10 players in T and 6 in S. But each player in T plays 9 intra-T games and 6 inter games (against S). But T players earned half their points (each) in intra-T games. For T players, they earned half their points in T-T games.

But total points in T-T games is 45 (since 10C2=45 games, each awarding 1 point). So PT=90, so half is 45. That's okay; that works regardless of N.

But perhaps the kicker is to check whether the S players have earned half of their points in S-T games. Let's analyze N=16.

S players are 6. Each plays 10 games against T. So total S-T games is 6*10=60? Wait no. Wait number of S-T games is |S|*|T|=6*10=60. Then, in those 60 games, each game has 1 point, so total points from S-T games is 60.

Those 60 points are split between S and T.

According to the condition, S earned half their points from S-T games. So total points of S is P_S= (N -10)(N-11) when N=16, P_S=6*5=30. Then half of P_S is 15. So S earned 15 points from S-T games, which is 15 out of 60. Thus T earned 60 -15=45 points from S-T games. But T's total points are 90, so their half from S-T games would be 45, matching. So math here works.

So, according to equations, both N=25 and N=16 satisfy?

But this is problematic? Wait, the problem mentions "ten players with the least points". So in the case when there are 16 players, each of the ten players in T (the lower half) have earned 9 points each, presumably. Hmm.

Wait, with N=16, total points is 120. If S players (6 players) earned 30 total points => 5 points each on average. T players earned 90 total => 9 points each on average?

But this seems okay. However, does this setup actually create the bottom ten? If the T players have more points than the S players, then T wouldn't be the lowest. That's a contradiction.

Wait, that's a problem. Wait, if T has 90 points, and S has 30 points. Then each player in S has 5 points on average, and each player in T has 9 points on average, which is higher than S. Therefore, T isn't the ten players with the LEAST points; it's the other way around. That N=16 is invalid because S would be the lower scorers. 

Ah! That's critical. The problem states that T is the ten players with the least points. So if in total, S and T have points of 30 and 90, the "ten with least" are S, but S only has 6 players. Therefore, invalid. Hence, N=16 is invalid.

Therefore, only N=25 is valid. Because with N=25, P_S=210, so average in S is 210 /15=14. And P_T=90, average in T is 9, so T is indeed the ten with the least points. Therefore, N=25 is the answer.

Therefore, the logic here is that solving the quadratic gives two solutions, but we check which solution puts T as the ten with the least points, so only N=25 works.

Let me just recap.

Set up equations:

Total points in the tournament which is N(N-1)/2,

Total points from S games:  (P_S) = (N -10)(N -11)
Total points from T games: (P_T)=90.

Which comes from:

1. Each player in T earned half of their points in intra-T games. The intra-T games sum to 45 (since each game gives 1 point), so 45 must be half of P_T, so P_T =90.

2. Each player in S earned half their points in inter S-T games. Therefore, intra-S games had half points of S, so ((N -10)(N -11))/2 = half of P_S.

Therefore, P_S=(N−10)(N−11)

Then, equation: (N−10)(N−11) +90 =N(N−1)/2 .

Solving this quadratic gives two solutions: N=25 and N=16.

But for N=16, the set T would be of 10 players, but their average would be 90/10=9, whereas set S of 6 players would have total 30, i.e., 5 on average, hence S would be the lower. So the ten players with the least points would have to be S, but in our initial setup, T is denoted as the ten with least. Therefore, N=16 is impossible. Hence, N=25 is the answer.

Therefore, the answer is 25, boxed:

**Final Answer**
\boxed{25}
