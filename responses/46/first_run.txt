Okay, let me start by understanding the problem. The user needs to find the second derivatives of x and y with respect to time, expressed in terms of the potential U. U is given as a combination of gravitational potentials from two masses and a centrifugal term. 

First, I recognize that U includes gravitational terms and a centrifugal potential, suggesting it's in a rotating frame. In such frames, equations of motion include Coriolis and centrifugal accelerations. Since the centrifugal term is already part of U, the main remaining fictitious force is the Coriolis effect, which depends on velocity.

The user's thought process considered Lagrangian mechanics, which is appropriate. Using the Euler-Lagrange equations, the accelerations are derived considering the effective potential U. The key steps involve computing partial derivatives of U with respect to x and y, then incorporating the Coriolis terms, which introduce velocity components (dx/dt and dy/dt). 

Crucial points include:
1. Calculating the partial derivatives of U to account for gravitational and centrifugal forces.
2. Recognizing the Coriolis terms (2ω dy/dt and -2ω dx/dt) from the rotating frame's kinematics.
3. Applying the Euler-Lagrange equations to derive the final expressions for the accelerations.

These steps highlight the necessary components: the gradient of U and the velocity-dependent Coriolis terms. The final answer combines both, even though velocities aren't part of U, because they're essential in the rotating frame's equations of motion.
