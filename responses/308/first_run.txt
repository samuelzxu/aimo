Alright, let's break down the problem. We have a sequence defined recursively where the first three terms are 1, and each subsequent term is the number of real roots of a quartic equation. The goal is to find the sum of the first 1000 terms.

First, I compute the initial terms to identify any patterns. Starting from a₁ to a₁₀, we notice a non-repeating sequence. However, from a₁₁ onwards, a cycle emerges: [1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0], repeating every 9 terms. 

Next, I verify the cycle length and sum. Each cycle sums to 21. There are 990 terms from a₁₁ to a₁₀₀₀, which fit into 110 full cycles (990 ÷ 9 = 110). Multiplying the cycle sum by 110 gives 2310.

Adding the sum of the first 10 terms (1+1+1+2+4+4+4+2+0+0=19) to the cycle sum results in the total sum of 2329.

Key steps include recognizing the cyclical pattern and calculating the contributions from the initial terms and the repeating cycles.
