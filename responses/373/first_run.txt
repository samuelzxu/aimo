Alright, let's break down how I should approach this. The user wants me to identify which tokens in the existing reasoning are essential for future steps. I need to go through each paragraph and determine which sentences or phrases contain critical information needed for subsequent reasoning.

Starting with the first paragraph: The user outlines the problem of estimating time t2 when the radius shrinks from r0 to 0.95r0, neglecting changes in gravity. Key here is understanding the problem's setup, so mentioning the task and the key assumption (neglecting gravity change) is essential.

Moving to the discussion about free-fall time and whether it applies. The distinction between standard free-fall time and the small contraction here is important. The conclusion that the standard formula isn't directly applicable because the radius change is small should be kept.

The next part considers gravitational acceleration inside a sphere. The formula g(r) = -4/3 π G ρ r is derived here. This formula is crucial for later calculations, so it's a keeper. However, the problem's constraint to treat g as constant despite changing r is vital, so that assumption needs marking.

When the user models the motion under constant acceleration, the equation r(t) = r0 - 1/2 g t² comes up. This equation is fundamental for calculating the time, so it's essential. The subsequent solving for t when r=0.95r0, leading to t = sqrt(0.1 r0³ / GM), is the core result and must be preserved.

Discussions about alternative approaches (energy conservation, differential equations) are less critical once the constant acceleration method is settled. However, the conclusion reaffirming the derived formula as the correct answer under the problem's constraints is necessary to keep.

The final answer boxed is obviously essential. Each step that led to the derivation of the formula must be marked, including key equations, assumptions, and the final expression. This ensures that anyone continuing the reasoning knows which formulas and values to use without rederiving them.
