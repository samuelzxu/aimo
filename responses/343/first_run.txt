Okay, let's see. The problem involves a triangle ABC with given sides, a point D on BC, incenters of triangles ABD and ACD, and circumcircles leading to a point P whose maximum area triangle BPC is needed. The answer format is a - b√c, and we need a + b + c.

The key steps here are figuring out which parts of the reasoning are crucial for continuing. The user has already laid out a detailed coordinate approach, calculating coordinates of incenters I_B and I_C, finding equations of circumcircles, and solving for point P. However, given the complexity, there's a need to identify which tokens are essential for future steps.

First, the coordinates of points A, B, C are crucial because they form the basis for all subsequent calculations. Assigning coordinates allows the rest of the problem to be solved using coordinate geometry. Therefore, the coordinates of A, B, and C must be kept.

Next, the formulas for the incenters I_B and I_C are derived using weighted coordinates based on side lengths. The expressions for their coordinates involve variables like d (position of D on BC) and AD (distance from A to D). These formulas are vital as they are used to compute the centers of the circumcircles later.

The critical insight that the area of triangle BPC depends on the y-coordinate of point P simplifies the problem significantly. Realizing that the area is proportional to |y_P| means that maximizing this y-coordinate is the key. This insight reduces the problem's complexity by focusing solely on the y-coordinate.

Moreover, the calculation of the incenter of triangle ABC is a crucial step because it provides a potential maximum point for P, even though later steps show it's not the case. However, understanding the incenter's coordinates helps in comparing with possible positions of P.

Finally, the exploration of specific cases, like D being the midpoint, and the resulting coordinates of incenters and P, though computationally heavy, are essential for verifying the maximum. These steps, even if partially kept, highlight the methodical approach needed for such geometry problems.

Thus, the essential tokens include the coordinates of A, B, C, the derivation of incenter coordinates, the relation between the area and y-coordinate, and key intermediate results like the incenter of ABC. These elements collectively form the foundation for solving the problem and must be retained for future reasoning steps.
