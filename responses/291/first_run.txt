Okay, let me start by understanding the problem. The question is about finding the inner radius of the torus in an AGN using the Barvainis model. The given parameters are a dust sublimation temperature of 900 K and a bolometric luminosity of 1.5×10^46 erg/s with a bolometric correction of 5 for UV luminosity.

First, I need to recall the Barvainis model formula. From what I remember, the radius (R) is proportional to the square root of the luminosity (L) divided by the temperature (T) raised to some power. The exact formula might involve scaling factors, so it's important to get that right. 

The user mentioned using a bolometric correction. That means the UV luminosity (L_UV) is the bolometric luminosity divided by 5. Calculating that, L_UV becomes 3×10^45 erg/s. 

Next, the formula from the Barvainis model. If the standard formula uses a temperature of 1500 K, we need to adjust for the given 900 K. The scaling factor for temperature would be (1500/900)^2, which is (5/3)^2 ≈ 2.778. 

The original Barvainis formula might look like R = 0.2 * sqrt(L_UV / 1e44) pc for T = 1500 K. Plugging in L_UV = 3×10^45 erg/s (which is 30×1e44), the square root of 30 is about 5.477. So, 0.2 * 5.477 gives ≈ 1.095 pc. Then, applying the temperature scaling factor of 2.778, the radius becomes ≈ 3.04 pc. This matches option D.

However, when I tried a detailed radiation balance approach, I initially got around 0.23 pc, which didn't match any options. Realizing that the question explicitly mentions using the Barvainis model, I focused on the scaling approach. The discrepancy arises because the model includes empirical factors that might account for dust properties or geometry, which a pure physics approach might miss.

Key steps to retain for future reasoning:
1. L_UV calculation using the bolometric correction.
2. The Barvainis formula scaling with sqrt(L_UV) and temperature adjustment.
3. The temperature scaling factor (1500/900)^2.
4. Final computation leading to ≈3 pc.
