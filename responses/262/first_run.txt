Okay, let's break down how I approached this problem. The goal was to prove that the angle bisector of angle A in trapezoid ABCD also bisects side CD, given that AD is parallel to BC and AB equals AD plus BC. 

First, I considered different methods like coordinate geometry, angle bisector theorem, and properties of trapezoids. I decided coordinate geometry would be straightforward for handling lengths and midpoints. Setting up the coordinates correctly was crucial. I placed point A at the origin and aligned AD along the x-axis for simplicity. Points B and C were assigned coordinates based on the height h and the lengths of the bases.

Next, I used the given condition AB = AD + BC to express relationships between variables. This step was vital to link the geometric configuration with algebraic equations. I derived the equation for AB's length and set it equal to the sum of AD and BC.

Then, I focused on finding the equation of the angle bisector of angle A. Using vector addition of normalized direction vectors from AD and AB provided the direction of the bisector. Parametric equations for both the angle bisector and side CD were established, and solving their intersection point was key. 

By equating the parametric equations and substituting the given condition, I found the parameter values leading directly to the midpoint of CD. This showed the bisector intersects CD at its midpoint, completing the proof.

Throughout, I verified steps with vector approaches and considered alternative methods like the angle bisector theorem but found coordinate geometry most effective. The critical insight was substituting AB's length into the parameter equation, simplifying it to confirm the midpoint intersection.
