Alright, let's break down how to approach this problem. The task is to match each radioactive decay process in List-I with the correct emitted particles from List-II. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Understanding Decay Types**:
   - **Alpha decay (α)**: Reduces atomic number by 2 and mass number by 4.
   - **Beta minus decay (β⁻)**: Increases atomic number by 1 (neutron converts to proton).
   - **Beta plus decay (β⁺)**: Decreases atomic number by 1 (proton converts to neutron).

2. **Analyzing Each Process**:
   - **Process P**: ${ }_{92}^{238} \text{U} \rightarrow{ }_{91}^{234} \text{Pa}$
     - Mass decreases by 4 (suggests α decay).
     - Atomic number decreases by 1. However, α alone would reduce it by 2. Hence, an α decay followed by a β⁻ decay (increases atomic number by 1) results in net decrease of 1. <keep>one α and one β⁻ (Option 4)</keep>

   - **Process Q**: ${ }_{82}^{214} \text{Pb} \rightarrow{ }_{82}^{210} \text{Pb}$
     - Mass decreases by 4 (α decay), but atomic number remains same. So, α decay followed by two β⁻ decays to balance the atomic number. <keep>one α and two β⁻ (Option 3)</keep>

   - **Process R**: ${ }_{81}^{210} \text{Tl} \rightarrow{ }_{82}^{206} \text{Pb}$
     - Mass decreases by 4 (α decay), atomic number increases by 1. α decay reduces atomic number by 2 (to 79), then three β⁻ decays increase it by 3 (to 82). <keep>one α and three β⁻ (Option 2)</keep>

   - **Process S**: ${ }_{91}^{228} \text{Pa} \rightarrow{ }_{88}^{224} \text{Ra}$
     - Mass decreases by 4 (α decay), atomic number decreases by 3. α decay reduces atomic number by 2 (to 89), then a β⁺ decay reduces it by 1 (to 88). <keep>one α and one β⁺ (Option 1)</keep>

3. **Matching with Options**:
   - **Option A** matches P→4, Q→3, R→2, S→1, aligning with all deductions. Other options either misalign decay types or counts. <keep>Option A states exactly this mapping</keep>

Key tokens to retain include specific decay counts (e.g., "one α and one β⁻"), correct option mappings (e.g., "Option 4"), and conclusions like "Option A states exactly this mapping." These tokens are crucial for validating each step and ensuring the correct final answer.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 5: <keep>one alpha and one beta minus. So for process P, the emitted particles would be one alpha and one beta minus. So P should be matched with 4.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 7: <keep>Q would be 3. Let me confirm: Pb-214 → Pb-210. Change in atomic number: 82→82. So if we have an alpha decay, mass down by 4, atomic number down by 2 to 80. To get back to 82, need two beta minus. So, 2 beta minus and 1 alpha. Hence, Q is 3.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 4: <keep>So total three beta minus and one alpha. So Option 2. Hence, R matches with 2.</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 5: <keep>Therefore, total emissions: one alpha and one beta plus. So that is option 1. Hence, S matches with 1.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 2: <keep>Option A: P→4, Q→3, R→2, S→1. So that's exactly what I got.</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, the correct answer must be (A).</keep>

\boxed{A}
