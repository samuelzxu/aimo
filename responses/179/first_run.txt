Okay, let's break down the problem step by step to ensure we find the correct solution.

**Problem Understanding**:
We need to find the smallest integer \( N \) such that \( g(N) \) (the sum of digits of \( f(N) \) when written in base-8) when converted to hexadecimal (base-16) has at least one digit that is a letter (A-F). This means \( g(N) \) must be at least 10, as hexadecimal digits from 10 onwards are represented by letters.

**Steps to Solve**:
1. **Determine \( f(N) \)**:
   - \( f(N) \) is the sum of the digits of \( N \) when written in base-4.
2. **Determine \( g(N) \)**:
   - Convert \( f(N) \) to base-8 and sum its digits.
3. **Find Minimum \( g(N) \geq 10 \)**:
   - The smallest number whose base-8 digits sum to 10 is \( 37_8 \) (3 + 7 = 10), which is 31 in decimal.
4. **Find \( N \) such that \( f(N) = 31 \)**:
   - Find the smallest \( N \) such that the sum of its base-4 digits is 31.

**Finding \( N \)**:
- To minimize \( N \), place the largest digits (3) in the lowest possible positions (rightmost) in base-4.
- The number \( 31 \) divided by 3 gives 10 with a remainder of 1. Thus, the smallest \( N \) in base-4 is `1` followed by ten `3`s: \( 13333333333_4 \).

**Conversion to Decimal**:
- Convert \( 13333333333_4 \) to decimal:
  - This is \( 4^{10} + 3 \times (4^9 + 4^8 + \ldots + 4^0) \).
  - The sum of the geometric series \( \sum_{k=0}^{9} 4^k = \frac{4^{10} - 1}{3} = 349525 \).
  - Total value: \( 1048576 + 3 \times 349525 = 2097151 \).

**Final Calculation**:
- The remainder of \( 2097151 \) divided by 1000 is \( 151 \).

**Key Tokens to Preserve**:
- **Paragraph 2, Sentence 1**: "the sum of digits in base-eight (g(n)) is at least 10"
- **Paragraph 3, Sentence 2**: "the minimal number is 37_8 (31 decimal)"
- **Paragraph 4, Sentence 1**: "smallest n where the sum of its digits in base-four is 31"
- **Paragraph 5, Sentences**: "minimal number is formed by writing r followed by k 3s... sum of 31"
- **Final Answer**: "remainder is 151"
