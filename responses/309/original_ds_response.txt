Okay, so I need to solve this complex sequence problem. Let me carefully parse through the given conditions and see how to approach it step by step.

We have a sequence of complex numbers (z_n) with the following properties:

1. z1 and z2 are not real numbers.
2. For all n ≥ 1, z_{n+2} = z_{n+1}2 z_n.
3. For all n ≥ 1, the ratio z_{n+3}/z_n2 is real.
4. The absolute values |z3/z4| = |z4/z5| = 2.

We need to find the product of all possible values of z1.

Let me start by understanding the recurrence relation. The sequence is defined by z_{n+2} = z_{n+1}^2 * z_n. So each term depends on the square of the previous term and the term before that. It's a second-order recurrence but with multiplicative terms. So maybe the terms can be expressed in terms of exponentials or something?

But before jumping into that, let's note down the given conditions. First, z1 and z2 are non-real, which might complicate things because we have to handle complex numbers. The third condition says that the ratio z_{n+3}/z_n2 is real for all n. So regardless of n, when we take z_{n+3} and divide by z_n squared, the result is a real number. Since z1 and z2 are non-real, this ratio must be real even for the initial terms. Then the fourth condition gives us specific absolute value ratios between z3/z4 and z4/z5 as both equal to 2.

I need to find the possible values of z1, considering all these conditions. Let me try to write down the first few terms in terms of z1 and z2.

Given:
z1 is given.
z2 is given.
z3 = z22 z1 (from the recurrence, since z_{n+2} = z_{n+1}2 z_n, so when n=1, z3 = z22 z1)
Similarly, z4 = z32 z2 = (z22 z1)2 z2 = z24 z12 z2 = z25 z12
z5 = z42 z3 = (z25 z12)2 * z22 z1 = z2^{10} z14 * z22 z1 = z2^{12} z15

Similarly, we can write z6 and beyond, but maybe up to z5 is needed because the given ratios involve up to z5.

Now, let's check the condition z_{n+3}/z_n2 is real for all n. Let's start with n=1:

For n=1: z4 / z12 must be real. Similarly, for n=2: z5 / z22 must be real. For n=3: z6 / z32 must be real, etc. But since the problem states this is true for all n, then it must hold starting from n=1 onward.

First, let's handle the condition z_{n+3}/z_n2 is real. So let's compute z4/z12 and see what that implies.

Given that z4 = z25 z12 (from above), so z4 / z12 = z25. Therefore, z25 must be real. Similarly, for n=2: z5 / z22 must be real. Let's compute z5:

z5 = z2^{12} z1^{5}, from earlier (Wait, but need to double-check: z5 = z42 z3. z4 is z2^5 z1^2, so z42 = z2^{10} z1^4. Then z3 is z22 z1. So z5 = (z2^{10} z1^4) * (z22 z1) = z2^{12} z1^5.)

So z5 / z22 = z2^{12} z1^5 / z22 = z2^{10} z1^5. Therefore, z2^{10} z1^5 is real. Similarly, moving on, z6 / z32 must be real. But perhaps first tackle the first two conditions.

So n=1: z2^5 is real.

n=2: z2^{10} z1^5 is real.

Given that z1 and z2 are not real, so these must be non-real complex numbers, but their certain powers are real. That gives us information about the arguments of z1 and z2.

Recall that a complex number can be written in polar form as z = r e^{iθ}, where r is modulus, θ is argument. If z^k is real, then its argument must be a multiple of π. Therefore, kθ ≡ 0 mod π. So θ ≡ 0 mod π/k. Since z1 and z2 are non-real, their angles θ1 and θ2 should not be 0 or π mod 2π.

From n=1: z2^5 is real. So write z2 as r2 e^{iθ2}, then z2^5 = r2^5 e^{i5θ2} is real. Therefore, 5θ2 ≡ 0 mod π, so θ2 ≡ 0 mod π/5. Similarly, since z2 is non-real, θ2 cannot be 0 or π mod π. So θ2 = kπ/5 for some integer k not divisible by 5 (since otherwise θ2 would be 0 or π modulo π, leading to z2 being real if θ2 is 0 or π).

Wait, but θ2 must be such that 5θ2 is multiple of π, hence θ2 = (mπ)/5, where m is integer. But z2 is non-real, so θ2 cannot be multiple of π. Therefore, m should not be multiple of 5, but θ2 = mπ/5 where m is integer from 1 to 4, 6 to 9, etc. But since angles are modulo 2π, θ2 can be written as (m/5)π where m is 0,1,...,9. However, to make z2 non-real, θ2 must not be 0, π, 2π, etc. So m cannot be 0,5, etc. Therefore, θ2 is in { π/5, 2π/5, 3π/5, 4π/5, 6π/5, 7π/5, 8π/5, 9π/5 }.

Similarly, from condition n=2: z2^{10} z1^5 is real. Let's analyze that.

Write z1 = r1 e^{iθ1}, z2 = r2 e^{iθ2}

Then z2^{10} z1^5 = r2^{10} r1^5 e^{i(10θ2 + 5θ1)}. For this to be real, 10θ2 + 5θ1 ≡ 0 mod π.

But from the first condition, since z2^5 is real, θ2 = kπ/5 for some integer k (as above). Thus, θ2 = kπ/5 where k is not multiple of 5, mod 2π.

So 10θ2 = 10*(kπ/5) = 2kπ ≡ 0 mod 2π, since 2kπ is always an integer multiple of 2π, so 10θ2 ≡ 0 mod 2π.

Therefore, 10θ2 + 5θ1 ≡ 5θ1 ≡ 0 mod π, which implies 5θ1 ≡ 0 mod π. Therefore, θ1 ≡ 0 mod π/5, similar to θ2. But wait, 5θ1 ≡ 0 mod π ⇒ θ1 = mπ/5 for some integer m. So θ1 must be multiples of π/5. But since z1 is non-real, θ1 must not be 0 or π mod π. So θ1 = mπ/5 where m is not multiple of 5 modulo 10? Hmmm, same as θ2.

Therefore, both θ1 and θ2 are integer multiples of π/5 but not multiples of π.

So both angles θ1 and θ2 are of the form kπ/5, where k is an integer not divisible by 5, modulo 2π.

But θ1 and θ2 may differ. Important now.

So combining these two conditions, z2^5 is real, which fixes the argument of z2 to be multiples of π/5, and then z2^{10} z1^5 real gives that θ1 is also multiples of π/5, as 5θ1 must be an integer multiple of π, hence θ1 = mπ/5. So both arguments of z1 and z2 are fractions of π with denominator 5.

Now, moving to the absolute value conditions |z3/z4| = |z4/z5| = 2. Let's compute these ratios.

First, compute |z3/z4|. From earlier:

z3 = z22 z1

z4 = z25 z12

So |z3/z4| = | (z22 z1) / (z25 z12) | = | 1 / (z23 z1) | = 1 / ( |z2|3 |z1| )

Given that this equals 2, so 1/( |z2|3 |z1| ) = 2 ⇒ |z2|3 |z1| = 1/2. Equation 1.

Similarly, |z4/z5| = 2. Compute this:

z4 = z25 z12

z5 = z212 z15

Thus |z4/z5| = | z25 z12 / z212 z15 | = | 1 / (z27 z113) | = 1 / ( |z2|7 |z1|13 ) = 2

So 1 / ( |z2|7 |z1|13 ) = 2 ⇒ |z2|7 |z1|13 = 1/2. Equation 2.

Now, we have two equations:

1) |z2|3 |z1| = 1/2

2) |z2|7 |z1|13 = 1/2

We need to solve for |z1| and |z2|.

Let’s denote x = |z1|, y = |z2|. Then:

1) y3 x = 1/2

2) y7 x13 = 1/2

We can divide equation 2 by equation 1 to eliminate the 1/2:

(y7 x13) / (y3 x) = (1/2)/(1/2) = 1 ⇒ y4 x12 = 1 ⇒ y4 = x^{-12}

Therefore, y = x^{-3}

Substitute back into equation 1: y3 x = (x^{-3})3 x = x^{-9} x = x^{-8} = 1/2

Thus x^{-8} = 1/2 ⇒ x8 = 2 ⇒ x = 2^{1/8}

Since modulus is non-negative, real number. Therefore, |z1| = 2^{1/8}

Then y = x^{-3} = 2^{-3/8}

Therefore, |z1| = 2^{1/8} and |z2| = 2^{-3/8}

So that gives the moduli of z1 and z2. Now, the arguments are fractions of π/5. But we also need to determine the arguments of z1 and z2 such that all the terms z_{n+3}/z_n2 are real. Let’s recall that from conditions, z_{n+3}/z_n2 is real. So perhaps starting from n=1, 2, 3, etc., but we need to check if more conditions come from different n.

However, since the recurrence is defined for all n, perhaps after determining the general form, the ratios should hold for all n, but since we already used n=1 and n=2, maybe the later terms (n≥3) would just follow? Maybe let's verify that with the information we have.

But let me first summarize:

We have |z1| = 2^{1/8}, |z2| = 2^{-3/8}

Arguments of z1 and z2 are θ1 = kπ/5 and θ2 = mπ/5, where k, m are integers not divisible by 5, modulo 2π.

But the previous conditions from n=1 and n=2 only restrict θ1 and θ2 to be multiples of π/5, but now with more constraints? Let me check.

Wait, the n=1 condition is z4/z12 is real, which is equivalent to z2^5 is real (as established earlier). But z2^5 = r2^5 e^{i5θ2} which is real. So modulus is r2^5, argument is 5θ2. Therefore, 5θ2 must be congruent to 0 modulo π, so θ2 = kπ/5. Then, due to non-reality of z2, θ2 cannot be 0 or π, so θ2 ∈ { π/5, 2π/5, 3π/5, 4π/5, 6π/5, 7π/5, 8π/5, 9π/5 }.

Similarly, the second condition from n=2: z2^{10} z1^5 is real. z2^{10} is (z2^5)^2, so already real (from n=1 condition z2^5 is real) and positive since modulus squared. Wait, z2^5 is real, so its square is real and positive. Therefore, z2^{10} is a positive real number. Then z1^5 must also be real. Since z1 is non-real, but z1^5 is real. Therefore, z1^5 is a real number (could be positive or negative), so θ1 must satisfy 5θ1 ≡ 0 modulo π. That is, θ1 = lπ/5 for some integer l.

But similarly to z2, since z1 is non-real, θ1 cannot be 0 or π mod π, so θ1 ∈ { π/5, 2π/5, 3π/5, 4π/5, 6π/5, 7π/5, 8π/5, 9π/5 }.

Therefore, we can parameterize z1 and z2 as:

z1 = 2^{1/8} e^{i l π/5}

z2 = 2^{-3/8} e^{i k π/5}

where k, l ∈ {1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9}, since they cannot be multiples of 5.

However, we need to check whether these arguments of z1 and z2 lead to z_{n+3}/z_n2 being real for all n, not just n=1 and n=2. So maybe higher n terms will impose additional constraints?

For example, take n=3: z6 / z32 must be real. Let’s compute z6 in terms of z1 and z2:

From the recurrence, z5 = z1^5 z2^{12}

z6 = z52 z4 = [z1^5 z2^{12}]2 [z2^5 z1^2] = z1^{10} z2^{24} * z2^5 z1^2 = z1^{12} z2^{29}

Wait, is that right?

Let me step-by-step:

Given z4 = z2^5 z1^2

z5 = z42 z3 = (z2^5 z1^2)^2 * (z2^2 z1) = z2^{10} z1^4 * z2^2 z1 = z2^{12} z1^5

Then z5 = z2^{12} z1^5

Then z6 = z52 z4 = (z2^{12} z1^5)^2 * z2^5 z1^2 = z2^{24} z1^{10} * z2^{5} z1^{2} = z2^{29} z1^{12}

So z6 = z2^{29} z1^{12}

Therefore, z6 / z32 = z2^{29} z1^{12} / (z22 z1)2 = z2^{29} z1^{12} / z24 z12 = z2^{25} z1^{10}

We need z6 / z32 = z2^{25} z1^{10} to be real. Since both z1 and z2 have arguments in π/5 multiples, let's check:

z1^{10} = (2^{1/8} e^{i l π/5})^{10} = 2^{10/8} e^{i 10 l π/5} = 2^{5/4} e^{i 2 l π}.

Similarly, z2^{25} = (2^{-3/8} e^{i k π/5})^{25} = 2^{-75/8} e^{i 25 k π/5} = 2^{-75/8} e^{i 5 k π}.

Therefore, z2^{25} z1^{10} = 2^{-75/8 + 5/4} e^{i (5kπ + 2lπ)}.

Simplifying exponents:

-75/8 + 5/4 = -75/8 + 10/8 = -65/8

For the arguments: e^{i (5kπ + 2lπ)} = e^{iπ (5k + 2l)}

Since e^{iπ m} is real for integer m, because e^{iπ m} = (-1)^m. Therefore, z2^{25} z1^{10} is real because that exponential term is (-1)^{5k + 2l}.

Therefore, regardless of k and l (since 5k is 5 times an integer, which is multiple of 5, and 2l is even integer), 5k + 2l is integer, so the exponent is multiple of π. Therefore, the expression is real.

So for n=3, the ratio is automatically real because the exponential is a multiple of π, hence in the real line. Similarly, let's check for n=4, maybe:

z7 / z42 must be real. Let's compute z7.

z7 = z62 z5 = (z2^{29} z1^{12})^2 * z2^{12} z1^{5} = z2^{58} z1^{24} * z2^{12} z1^5 = z2^{70} z1^{29}

Then, z7 / z42 = z2^{70} z1^{29} / (z2^5 z1^2)^2 = z2^{70} z1^{29} / z2^{10} z1^4 = z2^{60} z1^{25}

z2^{60} z1^{25} = [ (2^{-3/8})^{60} e^{i60 k π/5} ] * [ (2^{1/8})^{25} e^{i25 l π/5} ]

Compute modulus:

2^{-3/8 *60 +1/8 *25} = 2^{-180/8 +25/8} = 2^{-155/8}

Exponent part:

e^{i (60kπ/5 +25lπ/5)} = e^{i (12kπ +5lπ)} = e^{iπ(12k +5l)}. Which is real because it's e^{iπ times integer} = (-1)^{12k +5l}

Therefore, z7 / z42 is real. Similarly, the trend is that for any n, z_{n+3} is formed by higher powers of z1 and z2, and their arguments would result in exponents that are multiples of π when considered in ratios with z_n2. Therefore, perhaps the conditions from n=1 and n=2 (θ1 and θ2 are multiples of π/5) ensure that all subsequent ratios are real. So maybe once these angles are fixed to be multiples of π/5, then higher terms satisfy the ratio condition automatically.

Therefore, the only constraints we have come from θ1 and θ2 being multiples of π/5, and the modulus conditions.

But before saying that, we need to check whether all these arguments work out. Because suppose there is a term that depends on θ1 and θ2 in such a way that maybe a higher n causes another condition. But since we checked n=1,2,3,4 (and for n=3,4 it's fine), perhaps inductively, all terms will satisfy the ratio being real.

So, given that the angles for z1 and z2 are multiples of π/5 (but excluding multiples of π), then combined with modulus conditions |z1|=2^{1/8}, |z2|=2^{-3/8}, hence these parameters lead to all the ratio conditions being satisfied.

But now, moving back to the problem: find the product of all possible values of z1. So, z1 is determined by its modulus and argument. The modulus is fixed as 2^{1/8}. The argument θ1 is lπ/5 where l is from 1 to 4, 6 to 9 (modulo 2π). However, we need to check whether there are additional constraints on l and k (arguments of z1 and z2) beyond just θ1 = lπ/5 and θ2 = kπ/5. For instance, even though θ1 and θ2 are determined up to multiples of π/5, is there any connection between l and k due to other conditions?

Wait, the fifth power of z2 is real, so z2^5 is a real number, but in the previous analysis, we also had that z1 and z2 are related through the condition z2^{10} z1^5 is real.

Given that z2^{10} = (z2^5)^2 is real and positive (since modulus squared is positive). Then, z2^{10} z1^5 is real implies that z1^5 must be real (as real times real is real). Since z1^5 is real, that's already encapsulated in θ1 = lπ/5, as we saw. So, once θ1 is multiple of π/5, then z1^5 is real, so product with z2^{10} (which is real positive) is still real.

Therefore, the arguments are both multiples of π/5. But do the angles θ1 and θ2 have to satisfy any particular relationship beyond that?

Additionally, we have the absolute value conditions which have given us |z1| and |z2|, so z1 and z2 are fixed except for their arguments. So the product of all possible z1 would be the product over all possible θ1, with modulus 2^{1/8}, which corresponds to different roots.

But wait, z1 must not only have θ1 = lπ/5, but we need to ensure that z2 also satisfies its own angle θ2 = kπ/5. However, there might be a relation between l and k because the terms in the sequence have to satisfy the third condition (z_{n+3}/z_n2 is real) for all n. But from previous checks, once θ1 and θ2 are multiples of π/5, all terms' angles will be multiples of π/5 leading to their powers being real when divided, as in z_{n+3}/z_n2. So is there any interconnection between θ1 and θ2 through some other term?

Wait, let's analyze z_{n+3}/z_n2. For it to be real, the exponent part has to be multiple of π. Let's for general n, try to see how the angles work. But perhaps the angles follow some recursion. Let's think recursively.

For the sequence z_n, with recurrence z_{n+2}=z_{n+1}^2 z_n, so the modulus is handled by |z_{n+2}| = |z_{n+1}|^2 |z_n}|, and arguments satisfy arg(z_{n+2}) = 2 arg(z_{n+1}) + arg(z_n}) mod 2π.

But considering that all z_{n} for n ≥1 will have arguments being some multiples of π/5. Let's check that by induction.

Given z1 and z2 have arguments θ1 and θ2 being multiples of π/5. Then z3 = z22 z1, so its argument is 2θ2 + θ1. Since θ1 and θ2 are multiples of π/5, then 2θ2 is multiple of 2π/5, and θ1 is multiple of π/5, so 2θ2 + θ1 is multiple of π/5. So z3 has argument multiple of π/5.

Similarly, z4 = z32 z2, which has argument 2*(2θ2 + θ1) + θ2 = 5θ2 + 2θ1. But since θ2 and θ1 are multiples of π/5, this is again a multiple of π/5. Continue then z5's argument is 2 arg(z4) + arg(z3) = 2*(5θ2 + 2θ1) + (2θ2 + θ1) = 10θ2 +4θ1 + 2θ2 +θ1 =12θ2 +5θ1. Which is again multiple of π/5. And so on. By induction, all arguments will be multiples of π/5, since the recurrence for arguments is linear with coefficients multiplying by 2 and adding previous terms. Each term is a combination of θ1 and θ2 with coefficients that keep the sum a multiple of π/5. Therefore, all terms z_n have arguments as integer multiples of π/5. Therefore, for z_{n} where n ≥1, z_{n}^5 is real. Because (multiple of π/5)*5 = multiple of π. Hence, modulo 2π, 5θn ≡ 0 modulo π, so zn^5 is real.

But then in the ratio z_{n+3}/z_n2, since both z_{n+3}^5 and z_n^{10} are real (as z_{n+3}^5 is real and z_n^{10} is (z_n^5)^2 which is real), then z_{n+3}/z_n2 would be real if z_{n+3}/z_n2 is a real number divided by a real number. Wait, not necessarily. Because z_{n+3}/z_n2 = (z_{n+3}) / (z_n2). But if z_{n+3} has a complex number with angle multiple of π/5, then z_n2 has angle 2 * multiple of π/5. So, the ratio angle is (multiple of π/5 - 2 multiple of π/5) which is still multiple of π/5. But to be real, the angle of the ratio must be multiple of π.

Wait, so ratio z_{n+3}/z_n2 has angle equal to θ_{n+3} - 2θ_n. But since θ_{n} is a multiple of π/5, θ_{n+3} is also a multiple of π/5. Therefore, θ_{n+3} - 2θ_n is a multiple of π/5, but for the ratio to be real, θ_{n+3} -2θ_n must be a multiple of π. Therefore, the requirement is:

θ_{n+3} -2θ_n ≡0 mod π.

But we need to enforce this for all n ≥1. How can we ensure that?

Since θ_{n} is defined by the recurrence relation of the arguments. The key is that the recurrence for arguments is linear. Let me formalize that:

Given the recurrence:

Arg(z_{n+2}) = 2 Arg(z_{n+1}) + Arg(z_n) mod 2π

We need for θ_{n+3} -2θ_n ≡0 mod π. So, for all n ≥1,

Arg(z_{n+3}) ≡2 Arg(z_n) mod π

But Arg(z_{n+3}) = 2 Arg(z_{n+2}) + Arg(z_{n+1}) mod 2π

Similarly, using the recurrence relation forward.

So, to write the condition, for all n ≥1:

2 Arg(z_{n+2}) + Arg(z_{n+1}) ≡ 2 Arg(z_n) mod π

Which can be rearranged as:

2 Arg(z_{n+2}) + Arg(z_{n+1}) -2 Arg(z_n) ≡0 mod π

Let’s call φ_n = Arg(z_n). So:

2 φ_{n+2} + φ_{n+1} - 2φ_n ≡0 mod π

But φ_{n} follows the recurrence φ_{n+2} = 2φ_{n+1} + φ_{n} mod 2π.

Therefore, φ_{n+2} = 2φ_{n+1} + φ_{n} mod 2π

So substitute into the previous equation:

2 (2φ_{n+1} + φ_n) + φ_{n+1} -2φ_n ≡0 mod π

Compute left side:

4φ_{n+1} + 2φ_n + φ_{n+1} -2φ_n ≡5φ_{n+1} ≡0 mod π

Therefore, 5φ_{n+1} ≡0 mod π for all n≥1.

Since this must hold for all n≥1, φ_{n+1} ≡0 mod π/5 for all n≥1. Wait, this seems like a problem. Because 5φ_{n+1} ≡0 mod π ⇒ φ_{n+1} ≡0 mod π/5. Which was already our earlier conclusion.

Therefore, indeed, for all terms φ_{n} ≡0 mod π/5, which is already required.

Since each φ_{n} is multiple of π/5, then for the equation 5φ_{n+1} ≡0 mod π, it just reiterates the same condition.

So φ_n ≡0 mod π/5 for all n≥1. Therefore, it's already built into the recursion given that initial angles φ1 and φ2 are multiples of π/5, then all φ_n will be multiple of π/5. Which gives that. So our condition of z_{n+3}/z_n2 being real is satisfied because θ_{n+3} -2θ_n = multiple of π/5 - 2 multiple of π/5 = (- multiple of π/5). For this to ≡0 mod π, the multiple of π/5 has to be ≡0 mod π. So that means:

(θ_{n+3} -2θ_n) ≡0 mod π ⇒ (- multiple of π/5) ≡0 mod π ⇒ multiple of π/5 ≡0 mod π ⇒ multiple ≡0 mod 5.

But θ_{n} is multiple of π/5, say θ_{n} = a_n π/5 where a_n is integer not divisible by 5 (since θ_{n} of some term can be 0 mod π, thus making z_n real. However, by assumption, only z1 and z2 are non-real, but perhaps when will subsequent terms be real or non-real?

Wait, maybe z1 and z2 are non-real but subsequent terms can be real. Wait, but third condition: z_{n+3}/z_n2 is real. But if z_n is real, then z_n^2 is real and positive. Similarly, if z_{n+3} is real then the ratio can be real.

But given that only z1 and z2 are given to be non-real. Later terms could be real or non-real, but need to ensure that z_{n+3}/z_n2 is real (i.e., z_{n+3} can be real or complex, but divided by z_n squared must be real.

However, from our previous discussion, all angles φ_n are multiples of π/5, so θ_{n} = a_n π/5. Therefore, θ_{n+3} -2θ_n = a_{n+3} π/5 -2 a_n π/5 = (a_{n+3} -2a_n) π/5. To be multiple of π, must have (a_{n+3} -2a_n) π/5 ≡0 mod π, so (a_{n+3} -2a_n)/5 ≡0 mod1 ⇒ a_{n+3} ≡2a_n mod5.

Similarly, this has to hold for all n≥1. So for every n≥1,

a_{n+3} ≡2a_n mod5.

But since a_{n} are integers modulo 5 (since φ_n = a_n π/5, θ_n in fractions of π/5), so a_{n} ∈ {1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9} but modulo 10? Wait, a_n could be in 0-9 but avoiding multiples of 5?

But if we take modulo5, a_{n} ∈ {1,2,3,4} modulo5.

Wait, θ_n = a_n π/5 mod2π. But since angles repeat every 2π, a_n can be any integer, but when mod10 (since 2pi=10pi/5). Therefore, a_n ∈0-9. But the initial angles are chosen so that a1 and a2 not divisible by5. Therefore, a1,a2 ∈{1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9} mod10.

But now, the recurrence for a_n can be written in linear terms.

From the argument recurrence, θ_{n+2} = 2θ_{n+1} + θ_n mod2pi. Since each theta is of the form a_n pi/5, then:

a_{n+2} pi/5 ≡ 2a_{n+1} pi/5 + a_n pi/5 mod2pi

Dividing both sides by pi/5:

a_{n+2} ≡2a_{n+1} +a_n mod10

So the sequence a_n satisfies the recursion:

a_{n+2} ≡2a_{n+1} +a_n mod10, with a1 and a2 not congruent to0 mod5.

Additionally, the condition a_{n+3} ≡2a_n mod5 for all n ≥1.

But since a_{n+3} ≡2a_n mod5 derived from the main ratio condition.

But since the recurrence is:

a_{n+3} ≡2a_{n+1} +a_{n+2} mod10

From the recurrence, if we can express a_{n+3} using the previous terms.

Alternatively, substitute the main recurrence into the required congruence.

Wait, for condition from z_{n+3}/z_n2 being real:

We have that a_{n+3} ≡2a_n mod5 for all n≥1. On the other hand, from the recurrence:

a_{n+2} ≡2a_{n+1} +a_n mod10

Let’s write a recurrence relation for n and then n+1:

For n:

a_{n+2} ≡2a_{n+1} +a_n mod10. (1)

For n+1:

a_{n+3} ≡2a_{n+2} +a_{n+1} mod10. (2)

But from the ratio condition:

a_{n+3} ≡2a_n mod5. (3)

But equation (2) gives:

a_{n+3} ≡2a_{n+2} +a_{n+1} mod10.

But from (1), a_{n+2} ≡2a_{n+1} +a_n mod10. Substitute into (2):

a_{n+3} ≡2*(2a_{n+1} +a_n) +a_{n+1} mod10

= 4a_{n+1} +2a_n +a_{n+1} mod10

= 5a_{n+1} +2a_n mod10

≡5a_{n+1} +2a_n mod10

But also, from condition (3):

a_{n+3} ≡2a_n mod5, which is equivalent to a_{n+3} ≡2a_n or 2a_n +5 mod10, i.e., less restrictive.

But using the equation from the recurrence:

a_{n+3} ≡5a_{n+1} +2a_n mod10.

Therefore, equate to the two expressions:

5a_{n+1} +2a_n ≡2a_n mod10.

Simplify:

5a_{n+1} ≡0 mod10.

Therefore, 5a_{n+1} ≡0 mod10 ⇒ dividing both sides by5, we have a_{n+1} ≡0 mod2.

Thus, for all n ≥1, a_{n+1} must be even. So starting from a2, all subsequent a_n must be even.

Wait, but original conditions are that a1 and a2 are not congruent to0 mod5, which are {1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9}, but now starting from a2, but with additional constraint from above conclusions. Wait:

Wait, derived that for all n≥1, a_{n+1} is even mod10. For example, n=1 gives a2 even, n=2 gives a3 even, n=3 gives a4 even, etc.

Therefore, starting from a2, all ak must be even. But z1 has a1 which is arbitrary (not divisible by5, but possibly odd or even). Similarly, a2 is even but also not divisible by5. So from the problem statement, z2 has to be non-real ⇒ a2 is even and not multiple of5. The possible a2 values are 2,4,6,8 modulo10. So, a2 ∈ {2,4,6,8} mod10.

But because theta is modulo2π, a2 effectively is 2,4,6,8 mod10. So possible a2=2,4,6,8 as numbers from1-10, hence angles of π/5 *2, π/5*4, π/5*6, π/5*8.

Similarly, in modulus 10.

But this requires that a1 can be any number not divisible by5 and odd or even? Wait, no, because for the requirement per the other conditions.

Wait, we started by z1 from 2^{1/8} e^{i l π/5}, where l ∈ {1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9}. But now this new constraint tells us that the subsequent terms even a3,a4,... must be even. But in order to generate all a3 from the recurrence, there might be constraints on a1. Let me check.

We have a3 ≡ 2a2 +a1 mod10. Since a3 must be even (from the recurrence condition). Since 2a2 is even (a2 is even), then 2a2 + a1 must be even. Therefore, even + a1 ≡even mod10 ⇒ a1 must be even. Therefore, a1 must be even. Hence, even though earlier theta1 can be lπ/5 with l=1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9, we now have a condition that a1 must be even. Therefore, possible a1 is 2,4,6,8 mod10. Therefore, l must be {2,4,6,8}, but l is not divisible by5, which they aren't. So essentially, a1 must be even.

Therefore, the possible theta1 values are:

θ1 = 2π/5,4π/5,6π/5=6π/5= π + π/5,8π/5=8π/5= π + 3π/5, 10π/5=2π- but mod10, hence theta can only be 2π/5,4π/5,6π/5,8π/5.

Similarly, theta2 is from a2∈{2,4,6,8}, hence theta2=2pi/5,4pi/5,6pi/5,8pi/5.

But that leads theta1 and theta2 restricted to being multiples of 2pi/5.

But let's test the case when theta1=2pi/5 and theta2=2pi/5.

Compute a3=2a2 +a1=2*2+2=4+2=6 mod10⇒ a3=6, even.

Next term a4= 2a3 +a2=2*6+2=12+2=14≡4 mod10⇒ a4=4 even.

a5=2a4 +a3=2*4 +6=8 +6=14≡4 mod10.

Wait, perhaps this will cycle. But since the numbers are taken mod10.

But the original constraint is that argument is an integer multiple of pi/5 mod2pi, which corresponds to a_n up to 10, and since angles are pi/5 periods, maybe working modulo10 is okay.

But regardless, as long as theta_n are multiples of pi/5 and even mod10, then the recursion continues.

But back to our prior analysis, now since we need to have a1=2,4,6,8(mod10). Similarly, a2=2,4,6,8 mod10, and the recursion gives a_n even, for all n≥2.

Therefore, the possible arguments for z1 are 2π/5,4π/5,6π/5,8π/5.

Which brings theta1 being 2pi/5, 4pi/5, 6pi/5, 8pi/5.

Hence, z1 = 2^{1/8} e^{i theta1} where theta1 must be one of these four angles. Therefore, there are four possible z1 values. Each z1 has modulus 2^{1/8} and argument in {2π/5,4π/5,6π/5,8π/5}. Therefore, the product of all possible z1 values would be the product over these four roots.

Alternatively, since these are 2^{1/8} e^{i2π/5}, 2^{1/8} e^{i4π/5}, 2^{1/8} e^{i6π/5}, 2^{1/8} e^{i8π/5}

Their product is (2^{1/8})^4 * e^{i(2π/5 +4π/5 +6π/5 +8π/5)} = 2^{4/8} *e^{i(20π/5)}= 2^{1/2} * e^{i4π} = sqrt(2) * 1 = sqrt(2)

But maybe 2^{1/8}^4 is 2^{4*(1/8)} = 2^{0.5} = sqrt(2). Yes.

And the exponents sum to (2+4+6+8)pi/5=20pi/5=4pi. e^{i4pi}=1.

Hence, product is sqrt(2)*1= sqrt(2). But according to possible errors....

Wait, wait, but theta1 also includes different a1's, but but wait, when we take z1 as 2^{1/8} e^{i theta1}, with theta1 as 2kpi/5 for k=1,2,3,4, then these are the 4th roots of what? Wait, e^{i theta1} are roots if theta1 = 2kpi/5. Wait, but n=5 roots. So for modulus, |z1|=2^{1/8}, arguments as above.

Product over all possible z1 is the product over the four roots:

Product_{k=1}^4 (2^{1/8} e^{i2k\pi/5})

= 2^{4/8} * e^{i2\pi/5(1+2+3+4)}( wait, sum of k=1 to4, so 1+2+3+4=10). Wait wait, no: indexing

Wait, when theta1 is 2pi/5, 4pi/5,6pi/5,8pi/5. So in terms of k, theta=2pik/5 for k=1,2,3,4,5, but k=5 would be theta=2pi, which is real. But our possible k are 1 to4 (since. But Wait wait, theta=2pi/5 is distinct where k=1, leading theta=2pi/5, k=2 is 4pi/5, k=3 is 6pi/5, k=4 is8pi/5. So then the exponent sum for k=1,2,3,4:

sum_{k=1}^4 theta1_k = 2pi/5 +4pi/5 +6pi/5 +8pi/5 = 20pi/5=4pi, as before.

Thus, the product of e^{i(theta1)} is e^{i4pi}=1. Then product of 2^{1/8} four times is (2^{1/8})^4=2^{0.5}=sqrt(2). Yes.

But hold on, but why theta1 excludes k=5? because real numbers.

Yes, since a1 must be even numbers from 2,4,6,8 mod10 (which correspond to theta=2pi/5,4pi/5,6pi/5,8pi/5). Hence, the product of all such z1s is sqrt(2).

But but the problem says "the product of all possible values of z1". So it is sqrt(2)=2^{1/2}, but should rationalize.

But to confirm, hold on: z1 has modulus 2^{1/8} and four possible arguments. Multiplying them all together we get product modulus as (2^{1/8})^4=2^{4/8}=2^{1/2}, and angles sum to 20pi/5=4pi, which is equivalent to 0 angle. So the product is 2^{1/2}*1=√2. So indeed, √2.

But wait, the problem is probably expecting the answer as 2^{1/2} with box, which is written as \boxed{\sqrt{2}}.

However, wait a second. Wait but, but z1 is a complex number, so possible values are 4 in number. If their product is √2, then yes. But Wait, is theta1 allowed to be 8pi/5? That's the same angle as -2pi/5. So these z1's can be written as 2^{1/8} e^{i2pi/5}, 2^{1/8} e^{i4pi/5}, 2^{1/8} e^{i6pi/5}, 2^{1/8} e^{i8pi/5}. Thus sum of these roots.

But what's the product of these roots. Suppose we multiply them together:

each z1: 2^{1/8} times roots of unity of order 5, but only the 4 roots from exponent k=1,2,3,4.

Wait, roots of unity of order5 are e^{i2pik/5},k=0,1,2,3,4. We are missing k=0 (angle0) and k=5 is equal to k=0. The excluded due to z1 being non-real, k=0 would be real.

So product over k=1,2,3,4 terms.

Normally, product over all nth roots of unity is1. Product over non-1 roots is product_{k=1}^{4} (x - e^{i2pik/5}) evaluated atx=1? No. Wait, actually, product of all nontrivial (k=1 to4) 5th roots is1, since (x^5-1) factors as (x-1)*Product_{k=1}^4(x - e^{i2pik/5}). If x=0, the product of roots term would be -(-1)=1. Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, no.

Wait, over the polynomial x^5 -1. The product of the roots (including x=1 is equal to -(constant term)/ leading coefficient. But when factoring x^5-1= (x-1)(x^4 +x3+x2+x+1). Then the product of the non-trivial roots is the product of roots of x^4+ x3 +x2 +x +1=0. By Vieta, the product of the roots is the constant term which is1. Since the polynomial is x^4 +x3 +x2 +x +1, then the product of roots is1. Therefore, the product of the nontrivial fifth roots of unity is1.

But this corresponds to exponents e^{i2pik/5} for k=1,2,3,4, their product is1.

But in our case, the e^{i theta1} where theta1=2k pi/5 for k=1,2,3,4, their product is1. Therefore, Product_{k=1}^4 e^{i theta1} =1.

Therefore, the four possible z1s have exponents multiplied to1, so (Product z1) = (2^{1/8})^4 *1= sqrt(2).

Therefore, the answer should be sqrt(2), \boxed{\sqrt{2}}.

But wait, I need to check that we actually can have all these four possibilities.

In other words, the answer requires theta1 to be 2pi/5,4pi/5,6pi/5,8pi/5. To ensure that z_{n+3}/z_n2 is real for all n,  but also that the terms from absolute values |z3/z4| = |z4/z5| =2.

But the modulus we already fixed. In terms of the angles, when we choose different theta1 and theta2, we need to check if they all satisfy the necessary ratio conditions. Wait, it's possible that although theta1 and theta2 are multiple of pi/5, but to satisfy the equation from n=3, perhaps some relation between them is required.

However, the previous analysis regarding the a_{n} sequence implies that we have started by constraining that both theta1 and theta2 are even multiples of pi/5. Because a1 and a2 are even, leading our Product the four possible z1's as even multiples.

But perhaps as long as a1 is even and a2 is even mod10, all conditions hold. Let me think:

For example, suppose that a1=2, then phi1=2 pi /5. Then, if a2=2 pi /5*5=?

Wait, wait, writing theta1=2*pi/5, theta2=4*pi/5. Then calculate the ratio z4 / z12 = z2^5 / z1^0 (since z4/z12 = z2^5 z12 / z12 = z2^5). Then, z2=2^{-3/8} e^{i4 pi/5}, so z2^5= (2^{-3/8})^5 e^{i20 pi/5} = 2^{-15/8} e^{i4pi}= 2^{-15/8}*1=2^{-15/8} which is real. So that's consistent.

Another ratio z5/z22= z2^{10} z1^5 / z2^2= z2^8 z1^5= (2^{-3/8})^8*(2^{1/8})^5 * e^{i(8 theta2 +5 theta1)}= 2^{-3}*(2)^{5/8} * e^{i(8*(4pi/5)+5*(2pi/5))}

Wait, I apologize modulus:

z2^8= (2^{-3/8})^8=2^{-3}

z1^5= (2^{1/8})^5=2^{5/8}

So modulus: 2^{-3} *2^{5/8}=2^{-3 +5/8}=2^{-24/8 +5/8}=2^{-19/8}

Angle:

Compute8 theta2 +5 theta1=8*(4pi/5)+5*(2pi/5)=32pi/5 +10pi/5=42pi/5=8pi +2pi/5=equiv2pi/5 modulo2pi).

Therefore,angle of2pi/5. So z5/z22=2^{-19/8} e^{i2pi/5}. Wait, but earlier calculations said z5/z22 should be real.

But this seems to conflict. Wait, maybe made a mistake.

Wait, no, earlier, from the ratio z5/z22, being real, which requires angle zero modpi. But according to this calculation, it's e^{i2pi/5}, which is not real. Contradiction.

Hold on, that's a problem. Which suggests there is a mistake in previous steps....

Wait, when we calculated z5 / z22= z2^{10} z1^5 / z22= z2^8 z1^5.

But fromtheta2=8*(4pi/5)+5*(2pi/5)=?

Wait z1's angle is theta1=2pi/5. So z1^5 has angle5theta1=5*(2pi/5)=2pi, which is real. Yes. Therefore, z1^5 is a real number.

Similarly, z2's angle istheta2=4pi/5. z2^{10}= (z2^5)^2. z2^5 has angle5*4pi/5=4pi, which is equal to0 modulo2pi. Hence, z2^5 is real, modulus (2^{-3/8})^5=2^{-15/8} and angle0. Therefore, z2^{10}= (z2^5)^2= 2^{-30/8}=2^{-15/4}, real.

Therefore, z2^{10}is real, modulus squared, z1^5is real. Therefore, their product must be real. How?

But wait theta2=4pi/5: then, when we compute z2^8 z1^5:

z2^8= (2^{-3/8})^8 * e^{i8*4pi/5}=2^{-3} * e^{i32pi/5}

But e^{i32pi/5}= e^{i(6pi/5)}= angle 32pi/5 -6pi/5= reduces to mod2pi:32pi/5 -6pi/5=26pi/5 ⇒ still multiple of2pi? Wait 32pi/5=6*2pi/5 + rest?

Wait32 divided by5 is6.4, so 6 fullcycles of 2pi: 6*2pi=12pi=60pi/5, subtract from 32pi/5:60pi/5 -32pi/5=28pi/5> No, that's negative. Alternatively, compute32pi/5=6*(2pi) +32pi/5 -12 pi=32pi/5 -60pi/5= -28pi/5≡2pi -28pi/5= (10pi/5 -28pi/5)= -18pi/5≡2pi -18pi/5= (10pi/5 -18pi/5)= -8pi/5= equivalent to 2pi -8pi/5= 2pi/5.

Wait, e^{i32pi/5}= e^{i(32pi/5 -6*2pi)}= e^{i(32pi/5 - 60pi/5)}= e^{i(-28pi/5)}= e^{i(-28pi/5 + 6pi)}= e^{i(-28pi/5 +30pi/5)}= e^{i2pi/5}.

Therefore, z2^8=2^{-3} e^{i2pi/5}

And z1^5= (2^{1/8})5=2^{5/8} e^{i5*(2pi/5)}=2^{5/8} e^{i2pi}=2^{5/8}*1=2^{5/8}

So z5/z22= z2^8 z1^5=2^{-3 +5/8} e^{i2pi/5}=2^{-19/8} e^{i2pi/5}

Wait, But this isn't real. But according to problem condition, z5/z22 must be real. Hence,this contradiction implies something went wrong.

So where is the error in the previous logic.

Wait, problem. So according previous calculation, z5/z22 not real. Which conflicts the problem’s condition. That means incorrect step in analysis.

Back to initial conditions. z_{n+3}/z n2 is real. That applies for all n≥1. So n=2 condition is z5/z22 is real.

Which here it's not; I get angle2pi/5. Which is not real—must be... this is a problem

So clearly, contradiction, so there must be an oversight in the reasoning.

Wait the critical link was thought that so since arguments are multiples ofpi/5 divided by powers that makes ratios real.

But there's a mistake here: while 5thetan=0 modpi so theta is multiple ofpi/5, but the fact that theta_{n+3}/zn2

Let me compute the angle for z5/z22.

As previously, z5/z22= z2^{10} z15 / z22= z2^8 z15. From angles:

Theta_z5/z22=8 theta2 +5 theta1

Given theta1= l pi/5 and theta2= k pi/5.

To be real, needs:

8 theta2 +5 theta1 ≡0 modpi

Therefore,

8*(k pi/5) +5*(l pi/5) ≡(8k +5l) pi/5 ≡0 mod pi

Therefore,

(8k +5l)/5≡0 mod1,

Which implies,

8k +5l≡0 mod5.

But 8k≡3k mod5, and5l≡0 mod5. Therefore,

3k +0 ≡0 mod5.

Therefore,3k≡0 mod5⇒k≡0 mod5 But k is an integer from1-4,6-9 modulo10, i.e., modulo5, from1-4, so if k≡0 mod5, impossible since z2 nonreal. Contradiction.

Thus... the only way for 3k≡0 mod5 is when3k≡0 mod5.

But since3 and5 are coprime, that impliesk≡0 mod5. Which is impossible because z2 is nonreal↔k not≡0 mod5.

Confliction. Hence, impossible.

That's a problem.

This implies that my prior reasoning that angles can be arbitrary multiples ofpi/5 is incorrect. Therefore, need to modify.

Thus, for z5/z22 to be real (from the problem's third condition), its angle must be0 mod pi. Thus

Theta_z5/z22 =8 theta2 +5 theta1 ≡0 mod pi.

Considering that theta1= l pi/5, theta2= k pi/5 as before, then:

8k pi/5 +5l pi/5=(8k +5l) pi/5 ≡0 mod pi ⇒8k +5l≡0 mod5.

 Which, 8k= (5+3)k ⇒3k mod5. Therefore,

3k+5l/5≡0 mod1?Wait:

Wait Wait, the calculation:

8k pi/5 +5l pi/5= (8k+5l) pi/5. To have this≡0 mod pi,

i.e., ( (8k +5l) pi ) /5 ≡0 modpi.

Which implies:

(8k +5l)/5 ≡0 mod1 ⇒8k +5l≡0 mod5.

But 8k≡3k mod5, so8k +5l≡3k +0≡3k≡0 mod5. Therefore,3k≡0 mod5⇒ k≡0 mod5.

But since k is in {1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9} as to prevent z2 from being real, k must not ≡0 mod5⇒contradicts.

Hence, this implies that our previous reasoning is incomplete. Thus the third condition, applied on n=2 (i.e., z5/z22 must be real) imposes the condition3k≡0 mod5, which can’t be satisfied unless k≡0mod5, which it isn't allowed. So this suggests that my previous assumption, that once theta1 and theta2 are multiple ofpi/5, then the ratios hold—perhaps flawed.

But this seems to collapse the problem altogether, contradictory—unless there is some relation between k and l making 3k+0≡0 mod 5. But since l can be any multiple as well, but no, the l term disappeared?

Wait, maybe there was a miscalculation.

Wait z5/z22=z2^{10} z15/z22=z28 z15.

So theta5/z22=theta_z5 -2 theta z2= theta_z5 -2 theta2.

theta_z5=12 theta2 +5 theta1:

Because from z5=z42 z3. z4=z25 z12 ⇒ theta4=5 theta2 +2 theta1,

z3=z22 z1 ⇒ theta3=2 theta2 + theta1.

Therefore, theta z5=2 theta4 + theta3=2*(5 theta2 +2 theta1)+(2 theta2 + theta1)=10 theta2 +4 theta1 +2 theta2 +theta1=12 theta2+5 theta1.

Therefore, theta_z5=12 theta2+5 theta1.

Then, theta_z5 -2 theta2=12 theta2 +5 theta1 -2 theta2=10 theta2 +5 theta1.

Therefore, theta_z5/z22=10 theta2 +5 theta1.

Thus requiring10 theta2 +5 theta1≡0 mod pi.

Not different from earlier.

Wait, yeah, wait as per prior: this angle is5θ1 +10θ2.

But according to recurrence theta1:

Earlier when used n=2, gives us this.

Wait, previously i computed that from z5 / z22, which led us:

z5 /z22= (z2^{10}z1^5)/z22= z2^8 z1^5.

Thus, the angle is8 theta2 +5 theta1.

But if we say alternatively, z5 is generated as terms so its angle is12 theta2 +5 theta1 (from prior calculation). Then z5/z22 would have angle(12 theta2 +5 theta1) -2 theta2=10 theta2 +5 theta1.

Wait, this is conflicting. Which one is correct?

I think confusion is arising from the definition.

z5 is defined as z42 z3:

If z4 has angle=5 theta2 +2 theta1.

Then, squared, z42 angle=2*(5 theta2 +2 theta1)=10 theta2 +4 theta1.

Then z3 angle is2 theta2 + theta1.

 Thus, z5 angle=10 theta2 +4 theta1 +2 theta2 + theta1=12 theta2 +5 theta1.

Thus, yes, angle_z5=12 theta2 +5 theta1.

Then, angle_z5/z22=12 theta2 +5 theta1 -2 theta2=10 theta2 +5 theta1.

But we also from z5/z2" being the same as z2^8 z1"^5, theta=8 theta2 +5 theta1.

This must equal.

Wait, that’s only possible if:

10 theta2 +5 theta1=8 theta2 +5 theta1

implies 10 theta2=8 theta2 ⇒ 10=8 which is impossible.

Therefore, there is a confliction here, suggesting an error in theta_z5. Which indicates some mistake in the angle calculation.

Hold on, wait, let's do it step by step:

Define theta_n := arg(z_n)/pi.

So, z1: theta1 = arg(z1)/pi.

z2: theta2 = arg(z2)/pi.

Then the recurrence becomes theta_{n+2}=2 theta_{n+1} + theta_n mod2.

Wait, because angles are considered mod2pi. But rescale by pi. Let's let phi_n= theta_n/pi.

Thus, the recurrence is:

phi_{n+2}=2 phi_{n+1} + phi_n mod2.

But previously, with theta1 and theta2 in terms of multiples ofpi/5.

But regardless, let me rethink.

Alternatively, considering angles mod2pi.

For computation, let's take arguments in terms of pi.

So z1 has angle: alpha_1= a1 *pi/5.

z2: alpha_2= a2* pi/5.

 a1 and a2 from1 to4, 6 to9.

Then, z3= z2^2 z1:

Angle_3= 2 alpha_2 +alpha_1= (2a2 +a1)*pi/5.

z4= z3^2 z2:

Angle4=2*(2a2 +a1)*pi/5 +a2 pi/5=(4a2 + 2a1 +a2)*pi/5=(5a2 +2a1)*pi/5 =5a2 *pi/5 +2a1*pi/5= a2 pi +2a1 pi/5.

So, Angle4= a2 pi +2a1 pi/5= multiple of pi (when a2 is integer). Thus, Angle4= (a2 mod2) pi +2a1 pi/5.

But since modulus of angles2pi, and if a2 even number:

If a2 is even (since a2 is 2,4,6,8), then a2 pi= multiple of2pi: yes,2pi.

But a2 is even ⇒ a2=2,4,6,8, so for example, a2=2⇒2 pi/5*pi? Wait alpha_2= a2 pi/5, so alpha4= when a2=2:

 alpha_4= (5*2 +2a1)pi/5=(10 +2a1)pi/5=2pi +2a1 pi/5≡2a1 pi/5 mod2pi.

Similarly, therefore, alpha4≡2a1 pi/5 mod2pi.

Similarly for even a2=4,6,8:

 alpha_4= (5a2 +2a1)pi/5= a2 pi +2a1 pi/5≡2a1 pi/5 mod2pi. Since a2 pi is pi multiple when a2 an integer. But since a2 even (mod10, but givena2\=2,4,6,8), but expressed in terms modulo2, but complex since a2=2,4,6,8 which modulo2 are0,0,0,0. Therefore, alpha4=(5a2)pi/5 +2a1pi/5= a2 pi +2a1pi/5. Sincea2 even,alpha4= multiple of2pi +2a1 pi/5≡2a1 pi/5 modulo2pi.

Thus, Angle4≡2a1 pi/5 mod2pi.

Then, z5= z42 z3:

Angle5=2 alpha4 +alpha3=2*(2a1 pi/5) + (2a2 +a1)pi/5=(4a1 +2a2 +a1)pi/5= (5a1 +2a2)pi/5.

SoAngle5=(5a1 +2a2)pi/5=(a1 +2a2/5) pi? Unclear.

Wait, in terms of multiples:

z5 angle=5a1 pi/5 +2a2 pi/5=( a1 + (2a2)/5 ) pi. Unless a2 divisible by5, does not make full multiple.

But more precise:

Angle5= (5a1 +2a2) pi/5= a1 pi +2a2 pi/5.

Therefore, z5's angle= a1 pi +2a2 pi/5.

Similarly, so theta_z5= a1 pi +2a2 pi/5.

Therefore, the angle of z5/z22= angle_z5 - 2angle_z2= [a1 pi +2a2 pi/5] -2( a2 pi/5 )=a1 pi +2a2 pi/5 -2a2 pi/5=a1 pi.

Therefore, angle ofz5/z22= a1 pi.

But since a1 iseven (from prior constrains a1=2,4,6,8), then a1=even, so angle of z5/z2’ is a1 pi, but a1 even ⇒ 2m pi=0 modpi. Yes, because a1=2m, soa1 pi=2m pi≡0 modpi.

Therefore, theta_{z5/z22}=0 modpi, which means is real. Thus, my early error was miscalculating.

Thank god.

So for example, a1=2:

angle_z5/z22=2pi≡0 modpi ⇒real.

Same if a1=4:angle=4pi≡0 modpi ⇒real.

Similarly a1=6:6pi≡0 modpi (6pi=3*2pi= multiplepifor modpi.

Yes. Regardless,angle of ratio= a1 pi.

Since a1 is even, it equals even* pi, which is0 modpi. Therefore,Z5/z22 real regardless of l andk.

Hence, the key is the fact that, if a1 is even, angle_z5/z22= a1 pi which is0 modpi(because a1 even。

 Therefore, my mistake before was in the manual calculation of the problem’s example, but in reality, we can have the angle of ratio z5/z22 as multiple ofpi and thus the term is real.

So indeed, all conditions for the ratio become satisfied if a1 is even. Therefore, theta1=2pi/5 etc., leading to product sqrt2.

Therefore, all possible z1 values are 2^{1/8} e^{i2pik/5} wherek=1,2,3,4 corresponding to a1=2,4,6,8 mod10.

Therefore, product is sqrt2 Thus,Answer is sqrt2, boxed.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\sqrt{2}}
