Alright, let's tackle the problem step by step. The goal is to find all numbers \( n \) for which there exist three roots of unity of order \( n \) whose sum is 1.

**Understanding Roots of Unity:**
Roots of unity of order \( n \) are complex numbers satisfying \( z^n = 1 \). They are \( e^{2\pi i k/n} \) for \( k = 0, 1, \ldots, n-1 \).

**Testing Small Cases:**
1. **\( n = 1 \):** Only root is 1. Sum of three 1s is 3, not 1. Invalid.
2. **\( n = 2 \):** Roots are 1 and -1. Combining two 1s and one -1 gives sum 1. Valid.
3. **\( n = 3 \):** Roots are 1, \( \omega \), \( \omega^2 \). No combination sums to 1. Invalid.
4. **\( n = 4 \):** Roots include 1, -1, i, -i. Using two 1s and one -1 sums to 1. Valid.
5. **\( n = 5 \):** Complex roots don't combine to sum 1. Invalid.
6. **\( n = 6 \):** Includes -1. Two 1s and one -1 sum to 1. Valid.

**Pattern Recognition:**
For even \( n \), -1 is always a root. Thus, combining two 1s and one -1 always works. For odd \( n \), the only real root is 1, and combining complex roots can't achieve sum 1.

**General Conclusion:**
All even positive integers \( n \) allow such a sum, while odd integers do not. The key factor is the presence of -1 as a root in even \( n \).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\text{All even positive integers}}

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 2: <keep>When \( n = 1 \), the only root of unity is 1 itself. So we need to add three 1s to get 1. But 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 ≠ 1, so \( n = 1 \) doesn't work.</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 5: <keep>the combination 1 + 1 - 1 equals 1. So yes, for \( n = 2 \), we can have three roots (two 1s and one -1) that sum to 1.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 6: <keep>1 + \( \omega \) + \( \omega^2 = 0 \), as they are the roots of \( z^3 - 1 = 0 \), so the sum is zero.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 5: <keep>taking two 1s and a -1. Wait, but for n=4, is -1 a root of unity? Yes, since (-1)^4 = 1.</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 2: <keep>if none of the roots is 1. Then all three are primitive 5th roots. But sum of three primitive 5th roots equal to 1? Not obvious.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 3: <keep>For example, 1 + 1 + (-1) =1. So taking two 1s and a -1. Wait, but for n=6, is -1 a root of unity? Yes, since (-1)^6 = 1.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 1: <keep>So n=2: works. n=3: doesn't. n=4: works. n=5: nope. n=6: works. Maybe all even numbers?</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 3: <keep>For any even n, the roots of unity include -1, so maybe two 1s and a -1. But here's a problem: only in even n where 2 divides n, because -1 is a primitive 2nd root of unity, so in any even n, -1 is an n-th root of unity. Therefore, 1,1,-1 sum to 1. So for any even n ≥2, we can express 1 as the sum of three roots: two 1s and one -1. Hence, all even numbers n work.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 6: <keep>But n=7 is odd. Let's see if for n=7, any three roots add up to 1. It's hard. Let's first check n=3,5,7.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 2: <keep>But unless their angles sum to 0 (mod 2π), their vector sum may not be real. Wait, but 1 is real. So the sum of three roots must be real, hence it's necessary that either they are all real, or the imaginary parts cancel.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 4: <keep>For odd n, if we take three roots of unity summing to 1, which is real, we either take three 1's (sum=3), or take one 1 and a pair of complex conjugate roots (so their sum is real). So let's assume the latter. So, the sum of three roots of unity is 1 if and only if it is 1 + (a + \overline{a}) =1 + 2Re(a). For some root a of order n. Therefore, 1 + 2Re(a)=1 ⇒ Re(a)=0. But Re(a)=0 implies a is i or -i, which are 4th roots.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 5: <keep>Therefore, there are no roots a with Re(a)=0 for odd n>1. Therefore, for odd n>1, there are no three roots of unity (which include only 1 as the real root) whose sum is 1.</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, conclusion: all even numbers n ≥2. But the problem didn't say "positive integers", but let's check n=0? Probably n should be a positive integer.</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 4: <keep>Hence, the answer is all even integers greater than or equal to 2, which can be written as \boxed{2k} for integer \( k \geq 1 \), but in the context of the problem, where numbers \( n \) refer to positive integers, we can present it as all even positive integers.</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, the conclusion is that the numbers n are all even positive integers.</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 2: <keep>\boxed{\text{All even positive integers}}</keep>
