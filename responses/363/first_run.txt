Okay, so the problem is asking for the maximum value of n_i/k where n_i are positive integers such that the floor of their cube root is k, k divides each n_i, and there are exactly 70 such numbers. Let me walk through how to approach this.

First, when the floor of the cube root of n_i is k, that means n_i is in the range [k³, (k+1)³ - 1]. So n_i must be between k cubed and just less than (k+1) cubed. Since k divides each n_i, each n_i can be written as k*m where m is an integer. So substituting, we get that k*m has to be in [k³, (k+1)³ - 1]. Dividing through by k gives m in [k², (k+1)³/k - 1/k].

But (k+1)³ expands to k³ + 3k² + 3k + 1. Subtracting 1 gives k³ + 3k² + 3k, and dividing by k (since we're looking for m) gives k² + 3k + 3. Since m has to be an integer, the maximum value of m is k² + 3k + 3 because (k+1)³ - 1 is exactly divisible by k. 

Next, the number of valid m values is the count of integers from k² to k² + 3k + 3. The total number is (k² + 3k + 3) - k² + 1 = 3k + 4. We’re told there are exactly 70 such numbers, so set up the equation 3k + 4 = 70. Solving this gives 3k = 66, so k = 22.

Finally, substitute k = 22 into the expression for the maximum m. That's 22² + 3*22 + 3, which is 484 + 66 + 3 = 553. Thus, the maximum value of n_i/k is 553.

Here are the essential tokens to keep for future reasoning steps:

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 1: <keep>n_i is in the range [k³, (k+1)³ - 1].</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 3: <keep>the maximum value of m is k² + 3k + 3 because (k+1)³ - 1 is exactly divisible by k.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 2: <keep>set up the equation 3k + 4 = 70. Solving this gives 3k = 66, so k = 22.</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 1: <keep>substitute k = 22 into the expression for the maximum m. That's 22² + 3*22 + 3, which is 484 + 66 + 3 = 553.</keep>
