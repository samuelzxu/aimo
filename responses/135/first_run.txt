Okay, I need to determine which frequency ranges are suitable for the radio telescope aimed at studying dark energy through a galaxy-redshift survey. The key is the 21 cm hydrogen line, which has a rest frequency of 1420 MHz. Observed frequencies will be redshifted, so the telescope needs multiple bands to cover different redshifts.

First, I calculate the redshift for each option:

- **Option a (500-700 MHz)** covers z≈1.03–1.84.
- **Option b (300-450 MHz)** covers z≈2.15–3.73.
- **Option c (1-1.2 GHz)** covers z≈0.18–0.42.
- **Option d (20-80 MHz)** is too high (z≈16-70), not practical for galaxies.
- **Option e (100-400 MHz)** covers z≈2.55–13.2 at the low end, but up to 400 MHz gives z≈2.55.

Dark energy's effect is more significant at lower redshifts (z <2). Combining ranges that cover z≈0.18–0.42 (option c) and z≈1.03–1.84 (option a) provides two distinct bins, useful for constraining dark energy. Option D's higher redshifts (b and e) might be less relevant, and option B includes very high z. Thus, the correct combination is likely options a and c (Answer C). However, the analysis showed complexities, but the preserved tokens indicate critical calculations and key conclusions about redshift coverage.
