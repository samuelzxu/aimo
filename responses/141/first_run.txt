Okay, let's go through the problem step by step.

First, the question asks about the correct statements regarding the cubic close-packed (ccp) structure. The options are (A) through (D). 

Starting with option (A): The number of nearest neighbors of an atom in the topmost layer. In a ccp structure, bulk atoms have 12 neighbors. But surface atoms would miss the layer above, reducing neighbors to 9 (6 in-layer, 3 below). So (A) is incorrect.

Option (B) mentions 74% packing efficiency. For ccp (which is fcc), the packing efficiency is indeed 74%, so (B) is correct.

Option (C) states octahedral and tetrahedral voids per atom are 1 and 2. In an fcc unit cell, there are 4 atoms, 4 octahedral voids, and 8 tetrahedral voids. Per atom, that's 1 and 2, making (C) correct.

Option (D) involves edge length being 2√2 times the atomic radius. For fcc, the face diagonal is 4r, relating to edge length a via √2 a = 4r, giving a = 2√2 r. Thus, (D) is correct.

So the correct answers are B, C, D. The essential parts to keep are the explanations confirming each option's validity, especially the calculations for packing efficiency, void counts, and edge length formula.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 3: <keep>The packing efficiency for fcc is indeed 74%, so (B) should be correct.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 4: <keep>Therefore, per atom, there are 1 octahedral and 2 tetrahedral voids. So (C) is correct.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 4: <keep>√2 a = 4r ⇒ a = 4r / √2 = 2√2 r. Therefore, the edge length a is 2√2 times the radius. So (D) is correct.</keep>
