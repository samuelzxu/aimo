Okay, let me figure out which parts of the reasoning are crucial for proving that translates of K have distinct barycenters. The key steps involve transforming the barycenter integral, relating it to the log-partition function, and using properties of convex bodies and log-concave measures.

1. **Defining the barycenter for translates**: Translating K by t changes the integral bounds, leading to substitutions like y = x - t. This shows the barycenter depends on t through the exponential weight shifted by t. (Paragraph 2, Sentences 4-7)

2. **Expressing the integral in terms of y**: The substitution y = x - t simplifies the integral, highlighting how ρ(y + t) introduces terms like e^{-2y·t}. (Paragraph 2, Sentences 8-10)

3. **Simplifying the weight function**: Observing that e^{-||t||²} cancels out in the ratio, focusing the dependence on e^{-2y·t}. (Paragraph 3, Sentences 1-3)

4. **Barycenter as a shifted expectation**: The barycenter becomes t plus a weighted average over K, emphasizing the role of the weight e^{-2y·t}. (Paragraph 4, Sentences 1-3)

5. **Log-concavity and convexity**: Establishing F(t) as convex because the Hessian is the covariance matrix of a log-concave measure, ensuring positive definiteness. (Paragraph 15, Sentences 1-2)

6. **Relating gradient of F(t) to expectations**: Connecting ∇F(t) to expectations under μ_t, showing the barycenter is t - ½∇F(t). (Paragraph 16, Sentences 1-3)

7. **Injectivity via convexity**: Using the convexity of F(t) to argue that s_{K+t} - t is a gradient, leading to injectivity. (Paragraph 17, Sentences 4-5)

8. **1D case intuition**: Analyzing the 1D scenario where translating K changes the barycenter monotonically, reinforcing injectivity. (Paragraph 50, Sentences 1-3)

9. **Projection onto direction delta**: Extending to higher dimensions by projecting onto the line connecting t and t', reducing to the 1D case. (Paragraph 63, Sentences 1-3)

Each marked section captures pivotal equations, substitutions, or properties that form the backbone of the proof. They ensure continuity in understanding how translations affect barycenters through weighted integrals and convex analysis.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 4: <keep>Let me formalize this. Let's define the translate K + t as the set {x + t | x ∈ K}. Then the barycenter s_{K + t} would be:</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 5: <keep>s_{K + t} = [ ∫_{K + t} ρ(x) x dx ] / [ ∫_{K + t} ρ(x) dx ]</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 7: <keep>So dx = dy and the integral becomes:</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 8: <keep>s_{K + t} = [ ∫_{K} ρ(y + t) (y + t) dy ] / [ ∫_{K} ρ(y + t) dy ]</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 1: <keep>Similarly, expanding this, ρ(y + t) = e^{-||y + t||2} = e^{-||y||2 - 2y·t - ||t||2} = e^{-||y||2} e^{-2y·t} e^{-||t||2}</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 3: <keep>Therefore, we can write:</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 4: <keep>s_{K + t} = [ ∫_{K} e^{-||y||2} e^{-2y·t} (y + t) dy ] / [ ∫_{K} e^{-||y||2} e^{-2y·t} dy ]</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 3: <keep>Which is t plus the barycenter of K with respect to the weight function e^{-2y·t} ρ(y).</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 1: <keep>Let me denote the numerator and denominator when translating by t as N(t) and D(t):</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 2: <keep>N(t) = ∫_{K} ρ(y + t) (y + t) dy = ∫_{K} e^{-||y + t||2} (y + t) dy</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 3: <keep>D(t) = ∫_{K} e^{-||y + t||2} dy</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 4: <keep>Let me denote μ_t as the measure on K with density proportional to e^{-2y·t} ρ(y). Then, ∇ F(t) = -2 E_{μ_t}[y]</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 3: <keep>Since F is convex, the gradient of a convex function is monotonic, which means that (∇ F(t) - ∇ F(t')) · (t - t') ≥ 0.</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 2: <keep>Since F(t) is convex, ∇ F is a monotone operator, so indeed (∇ F(t) - ∇ F(t')) · (t - t') ≥ 0.</keep>
- Paragraph 15, Sentence 1: <keep>Since Hess F(t) is the covariance matrix of the measure μ_t, which is positive definite if the measure is not supported on a lower-dimensional space, which here the support is K, which has nonempty interior, hence the covariance matrix is positive definite.</keep>
- Paragraph 16, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, G(t) = - (1/2) ∇ F(t), so ∇G(t) = - (1/2) Hess F(t).</keep>
- Paragraph 16, Sentence 2: <keep>Since Hess F(t) is positive definite, ∇ G(t) is negative definite.</keep>
- Paragraph 17, Sentence 4: <keep>Since the covariance matrices are positive definite, then h · Cov(μ_{t + τ h}) h ≥ 0 for all τ.</keep>
- Paragraph 17, Sentence 5: <keep>Therefore, the integral is non-negative, implying that ||h||2 is non-negative, which we already knew.</keep>
- Paragraph 23, Sentence 1: <keep>Since the covariance matrices are positive definite, then the integrand is positive for all τ ∈ [0,1], hence the integral is positive if h ≠ 0.</keep>
- Paragraph 23, Sentence 2: <keep>Therefore, ||h||2 > 0, so 2 ∫ ...>0, which says 0 < ||h||2= 2 (something positive}) which is consistent.</keep>
- Paragraph 29, Sentence 1: <keep>But since K is a convex body, the measure μ_t does not collapse to a point (for any finite t).</keep>
- Paragraph 29, Sentence 2: <keep>Hence, ∇ G(t) goes to zero.</keep>
- Paragraph 29, Sentence 3: <keep>So the mapping s_{K + t} = t + G(t) behaves like t plus a small perturbation when ||t|| is large, so that s_{K + t} is approximately t, so the function is approximately the identity at infinity, hence injective.</keep>
- Paragraph 31, Sentence 1: <keep>Since H(t) is a proper local diffeomorphism (since DH(t} is always invertible as Hess F(t) positive definite makes I - (1/2) Hess F(t) invertible, since for any vector v, v^T (I - 1/2 Hess F) v > 0, but actually we could also have negative terms.</keep>
- Paragraph 31, Sentence 2: <keep>Therefore, the Jacobian could have negative eigenvalues, and even zero eigenvalues.</keep>
- Paragraph 31, Sentence 3: <keep>Is it possible for DH(t) to drop rank?</keep>
- Paragraph 34, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, delta = 2 ∫0^1 Cov(mu_{t + τ h}) ) h dτ</keep>
- Paragraph 34, Sentence 2: <keep>Taking inner product with h:</keep>
- Paragraph 34, Sentence 3: <keep>||delta||2 = 2 ∫0^1 h^T Cov(mu_{t + τ h}) h dτ.</keep>
- Paragraph 34, Sentence 4: <keep>Since Cov is positive definite, then the integral is positive.</keep>
- Paragraph 34, Sentence 5: <keep>But how to relate.</keep>
- Paragraph 35, Sentence 1: <keep>Note that each term in the integral h^T Cov(mu_{t + tau h}) h is positive.</keep>
- Paragraph 35, Sentence 2: <keep>Therefore, ||delta||2 is determined by an average (integr和 over [0,1]) positive quantity.</keep>
- Paragraph 35, Sentence 3: <keep>Furthermore, only in the case when delta=0 would the Rv de integral be zero.</keep>
- Paragraph 35, Sentence 4: <keep>Hence, unless delta=0, we have ||delta||^2 positive ight? Therefore, if delta ≠ 0, then the right-hand side is positive, thus lihai delta||2 is also positive, hence it's a true statement.</keep>
- Paragraph 41, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, H(t) is proper (preimage of compact sets are compact), hence a local homeomorphism which is proper is a covering map.</keep>
- Paragraph 41, Sentence 2: <keep>But since R^n is simply connected, it's a homeomorphism.</keep>
- Paragraph 41, Sentence 3: <keep>Hence, injective.</keep>
- Paragraph 43, Sentence 1: <keep>Thus, the crux is utilizing the 1D result to higher dimensions.</keep>
- Paragraph 43, Sentence 2: <keep>Therefore, if we assume for a moment two translates K  + t and K + t’ have the same barycenters, which would imply their projections onto every direction must also be the same.</keep>
- Paragraph 43, Sentence 3: <keep>But particularly along e_direction = (t –(t}/|delta|.</keep>
- Paragraph 43, Sentence 4: <keep>The barycenter projection along e_direction is determined in 1D fashion as per above, thus mapping t to delta.</keep>
- Paragraph 43, Sentence 5: <keep>As. By 1D injectivity, their barycenter projections along e_direction woul need to differ, contradicting the assumption.</keep>
- Paragraph 44, Sentence 1: <keep>Hence, the barycenters must be distinct.</keep>
- Final Answer: <keep>\boxed{\text{Translates of } K \text{ have pairwise distinct barycenters.}}</keep>
