To determine all sets of real numbers \( S \) such that 1 is the smallest element and for all \( x, y \in S \) with \( x > y \), \( \sqrt{x^2 - y^2} \in S \), we analyze the conditions step-by-step:

1. **Singleton Set \(\{1\}\)**:
   - If \( S = \{1\} \), there are no pairs \( x > y \), so the condition is vacuously satisfied. This is a valid solution.

2. **Finite Sets**:
   - Consider \( S = \{1, \sqrt{2}\} \):
     - The pair \( (\sqrt{2}, 1) \) yields \( \sqrt{(\sqrt{2})^2 - 1^2} = 1 \), which is in \( S \). This set is closed under the operation.
   - Consider \( S = \{1, \sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}\} \):
     - Pairs \( (\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{2}) \), \( (\sqrt{3}, 1) \), and \( (\sqrt{2}, 1) \) all generate elements already in \( S \). This set is closed.
   - Extending this pattern, any finite set \( \{1, \sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, \ldots, \sqrt{n}\} \) for \( n \in \mathbb{N} \) can be shown to be closed under the operation by verifying all pairs.

3. **Infinite Set**:
   - The infinite set \( S = \{\sqrt{n} \mid n \in \mathbb{N}\} \) includes all square roots of natural numbers. For any \( x = \sqrt{a} \) and \( y = \sqrt{b} \) with \( a > b \), \( \sqrt{a - b} \) is in \( S \) since \( a - b \) is a natural number. This set is closed under the operation.

**Key Observations**:
- The problem allows for both finite and infinite sets provided they are closed under the given operation.
- Finite sets must be initial segments of the natural numbers' square roots to maintain closure.
- The infinite set is the maximal solution containing all square roots of natural numbers.

**Conclusion**:
The valid sets \( S \) are either the singleton set \(\{1\}\) or the infinite set containing all square roots of natural numbers. Finite sets like \(\{1, \sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, \ldots, \sqrt{n}\}\) are valid if they maintain closure, but the maximal solution is the infinite set.

**Final Answer**  
\boxed{\{1\}} and \boxed{\{\sqrt{n} \mid n \in \mathbb{N}\}}

Here are the essential tokens to retain for future reasoning steps, marked with their paragraph and sentence numbers:

- **Paragraph 2, Sentence 1**: <keep>If S = {1}, there are no pairs x > y, so the condition is vacuously satisfied. This is a valid solution.</keep>  
- **Paragraph 3, Sentence 2**: <keep>Pairs (√3, √2), (√3, 1), and (√2, 1) all generate elements already in S. This set is closed.</keep>  
- **Paragraph 4, Sentence 1**: <keep>The infinite set S = {√n | n ∈ ℕ} includes all square roots of natural numbers. For any x = √a and y = √b with a > b, √(a - b) is in S since a - b is a natural number.</keep>  
- **Paragraph 5, Sentence 1**: <keep>Finite sets must be initial segments of the natural numbers' square roots to maintain closure.</keep>  
- **Paragraph 5, Sentence 2**: <keep>The infinite set is the maximal solution containing all square roots of natural numbers.</keep>  
- **Final Answer**: <keep>Valid sets S are either {1} or {√n | n ∈ ℕ}.</keep>  

These tokens capture critical points about the validity of singleton and infinite sets, closure under the operation, and the structure of finite and maximal solutions.
