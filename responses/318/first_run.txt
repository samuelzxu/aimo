Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking how many positive integer divisors of \(2004^{2004}\) are divisible by exactly 2004 positive integers. 

First, I need to understand the prime factorization of 2004. Breaking it down:
- 2004 divided by 2 is 1002
- 1002 divided by 2 is 501
- 501 divided by 3 is 167
- 167 is a prime number

So, \(2004 = 2^2 \times 3 \times 167\). Raising this to the 2004th power gives \(2004^{2004} = 2^{4008} \times 3^{2004} \times 167^{2004}\).

Next, we need to find divisors \(D\) of \(2004^{2004}\) such that the number of divisors of \(D\) is exactly 2004. Any divisor \(D\) will have the form \(2^a \times 3^b \times 167^c\) where \(0 \leq a \leq 4008\), \(0 \leq b \leq 2004\), and \(0 \leq c \leq 2004\). The number of divisors of \(D\) is \((a+1)(b+1)(c+1)\). We need this product to equal 2004.

This means we need to solve \((a+1)(b+1)(c+1) = 2004\). Let \(x = a+1\), \(y = b+1\), and \(z = c+1\). Then \(xyz = 2004\), and each \(x, y, z\) must be positive integers. The task reduces to finding the number of ordered triples \((x, y, z)\) such that their product is 2004.

The prime factorization of 2004 is \(2^2 \times 3^1 \times 167^1\). To find the number of ordered triples, we consider how to distribute each prime's exponents among \(x, y, z\):

1. **For the prime 2 with exponent 2**: The number of ways to distribute 2 exponents among three variables is \(\binom{2 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{4}{2} = 6\).
2. **For the prime 3 with exponent 1**: The number of ways to distribute 1 exponent among three variables is \(\binom{1 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{3}{2} = 3\).
3. **For the prime 167 with exponent 1**: Similarly, the number of ways is also 3.

Multiplying these together gives the total number of ordered triples: \(6 \times 3 \times 3 = 54\).

Each ordered triple corresponds to a valid divisor \(D\) of \(2004^{2004}\) with exactly 2004 divisors. Therefore, the answer is \(\boxed{54}\).
