Okay, let's start by going through the problem and the existing reasoning to figure out which tokens are essential for future steps. The problem is about three monkeys dividing bananas under specific conditions, and the solution involves setting up variables and equations based on those conditions.

First, the problem mentions ratios and divisibility requirements. The key steps are:

1. Each monkey takes a portion from the pile, keeps a fraction, and divides the rest equally between the other two.
2. The final amounts each monkey has are in a 3:2:1 ratio.
3. All divisions must result in whole numbers.

The existing solution uses variables B1, B2, B3 for the bananas each monkey takes, and breaks them down into multiples (8a, 8b, 24c) to satisfy divisibility. It then sets up equations based on the given ratio and solves for variables in terms of k, leading to N=408k. The minimal N is 408 when k=1.

Now, to determine which tokens are essential for future reasoning:

- **Definitions of B1, B2, B3 as multiples (8a, 8b, 24c)** are crucial because they ensure divisibility. These define the structure of how bananas are divided.
- **Equations derived from the ratio 3:2:1** are necessary because they link the variables together and lead to the relationship between a, b, c, and k.
- **The substitutions (a=11k, b=13k, c=9k)** are critical as they express variables in terms of k, allowing the total N to be expressed as 408k.
- **Verification with k=1** confirms that all divisions result in whole numbers, validating the solution.

The final answer depends on these key steps, so the tokens related to variable definitions, ratio equations, substitutions, and verification must be retained.

Following the guidelines, I'll identify the exact sentences or phrases in each paragraph that contain these essential tokens and wrap them in <keep> tags.

Now, going through each paragraph:

1. **Question and Problem Understanding**: The initial problem statement is essential for context but might not need retention once the variables are set. However, the ratio 3:2:1 and divisibility conditions are critical.

2. **Defining Variables**: The breakdown of B1=8a, B2=8b, B3=24c and their divisibility requirements are key.

3. **Setting Up Equations**: The two equations from the ratio (First/Second=3/2 and Second/Third=2/1) must be kept as they lead to the relationships between a, b, c.

4. **Solving Equations**: The substitutions a=11k, b=13k, c=9k and deriving N=408k are essential for the final answer.

5. **Verification with k=1**: This step confirms the solution is valid and must be retained.

Each of these sections contains critical tokens that need to be preserved for future reasoning steps. The rest, while helpful in understanding, can be omitted once the key equations and substitutions are established.

Applying the <keep> tags to the specific sentences and phrases that contain these essential elements:

- **Paragraph 4**: The definitions of B1=8a, B2=8b, B3=24c due to divisibility.
- **Paragraph 5**: The equations derived from the ratio and their simplification leading to 9b=11f and b +4d=7f.
- **Paragraph 6**: Substitutions (b=11k, d=13k, f=9k) and the expression of N=408k.
- **Paragraph 7**: Verification with k=1 showing all steps yield integers and correct ratios.

By preserving these elements, the necessary information for reconstructing the solution is maintained without retaining redundant details.
