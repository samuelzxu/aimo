Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to prove that for any dimension d ≥ 2, there's a constant C(d) such that any symmetric convex polytope K in R^d can be approximated by another convex polytope L with at most C(d)ε^(1−d) vertices, satisfying (1−ε)K ⊆ L ⊆ K. 

First, I need to understand the key concepts. K is a convex polytope symmetric about the origin. We need L to be inside K but contain a scaled-down version of K by (1−ε). The number of vertices of L must be bounded by C(d)/ε^(d−1). 

Thinking about covering numbers and epsilon-nets in convex geometry might help. If we can cover the boundary of K with points such that their convex hull approximates K well, then scaling might allow us to achieve the required inclusion. 

Symmetric convex bodies can be approximated by polytopes with vertices corresponding to an epsilon-net on the sphere. The covering number of a sphere in d dimensions requires roughly (1/ε)^(d−1) points, which aligns with the problem's requirement. 

The plan is:
1. Construct an epsilon-net on the unit sphere S^(d−1).
2. For each direction in the net, take a point in K that maximizes the inner product (support function).
3. Show the convex hull of these points contains (1−ε)K.

By duality and covering number arguments, using the dual norm and properties of symmetric convex bodies, the number of vertices needed scales as (1/ε)^(d−1), hence the required bound. The key steps involve covering the dual sphere, bounding the number of points needed, and showing the convex hull contains the scaled-down K.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 3: <keep>In high-dimensional convex geometry, it's common to approximate convex bodies by polytopes. There's a classic result that says you can approximate any convex body by a polytope with a number of vertices exponential in 1/ε, but here we need the number of vertices to be polynomial in 1/ε, specifically proportional to ε^{1−d} = (1/ε)^{d−1}, which is polynomial.</keep>

- Paragraph 11, Sentence 1: <keep>The support function of K is h_K(u) = max_{x in K} <u, x>.</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 4: <keep>To make h_L(u) ≥ (1−ε)h_K(u) for all u, we need that for every direction u, at least one vertex of L has inner product with u at least (1−ε)h_K(u).</keep>

- Paragraph 16, Sentence 1: <keep>In fact, there's a theorem by Bronstein, which states that any convex body in R^d can be approximated by a polytope with N vertices such that the Hausdorff distance is less than ε, and N ≤ C(d) (1/ε)^{(d-1)/2}.</keep>
- Paragraph 17, Sentence 1: <keep>If we want L to contain (1 - ε)K, then equivalently, (1 - ε)K ⊆ L implies that for any y ∈ (1 - ε)K, y is in L.</keep>
- Paragraph 18, Sentence 1: <keep>Since L is generated by vertices which may not correspond to K's original vertices. So a vertex of (1 - ε)K is (1 - ε)v where v is a vertex of K.</keep>
- Paragraph 19, Sentence 1: <keep>Use the following strategy: For every direction u in a sufficiently dense net on S^{d−1}, include a vertex in L that is as far as possible in direction u.</keep>
- Paragraph 19, Sentence 2: <keep>Then, the convex hull of such vertices will be a good approximation.</keep>
- Paragraph 20, Sentence 1: <keep>The key is that even if K has many facets, by selecting a net of sufficiently small δ, we can adequately approximate the maximum in every direction by those points x_u.</keep>

- Paragraph 4, Sentence 3: <keep>However, since K is arbitrary symmetric convex polytope, we need to construct L with vertices bounded as C(d) ε^{1 - d} regardless of K's complexity.</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 1: <keep>Another approach: use the fact that the Minkowski difference (1 - ε)K is the same as K shrinked by ε.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 1: <keep>Wait, another approach: Let's construct L by taking the convex hull of a suitable ε-net on the boundary of K.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 1: <keep>Another Idea: Use the fact that the Minkowski difference (1 - ε)K is the same as scaling K by (1−ε).</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 1: <keep>To be more precise, if N is an ε-net on the unit sphere (with respect to the Euclidean norm), then the convex hull of this set will approximate the unit ball within ε in the Hausdorff metric.</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 1: <keep>Alternatively, consider that every x in K can be written as x_i + v, where x_i is in the net and v is small.</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 1: <keep>Alternatively, consider a different approach. Let’s note that since K is a symmetric convex polytope, it can be represented as K = {x ∈ R^d : |⟨a_i, x⟩| ≤ 1, i = 1, ..., m}, where a_i are the normal vectors to the facets.</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 1: <keep>But as the original K is arbitrary, we need a way to bound things independent of K.</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentence 1: <keep>Alright, this is challenging. Let's consider a duality argument. Since K is symmetric, K is the unit ball of a norm, and the dual space has the polar body K^*.</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 1: <keep>Wait, here's a thought inspired by covering numbers. If you can cover the sphere S^{d−1} under the metric induced by the gauge of K with N balls of radius ε, then taking the centers (normalized to be on ∂K) would create a polytope L so that (1−ε)K is inside L.</keep>
- Paragraph 14, Sentence 1: <keep>Alternatively, the width of K in any direction u is the difference between h_K(u) and h_K(-u); but since K is symmetric, the width is 2h_K(u). So, if h_L(u) ≥ (1 - ε)h_K(u) for all u, then L satisfies the required inclusion.</keep>
- Paragraph 15, Sentence 1: <keep>Returning to the original idea, if N = C(d) ε^{-(d−1)} points on ∂K can cover directions in the sense that any direction u has some x_i close to maximizing ⟨u, x⟩. These x_i's would be vertices of L, which upon taking convex hull gives L achieving the required inclusion.</keep>
- Paragraph 16, Sentence 1: <keep>Putting it all together, one possible approach is: 1. Use the dual norm to setup the covering. 2. Any symmetric convex polytope K induces a dual norm ||u||_K^* = h_K(u). 3. The dual sphere is S* = {u : ||u||_K^* = 1}.</keep>
