Alright, I need to figure out which parts of the reasoning trace are essential to keep for future steps. Let's go through each paragraph and see what's crucial.

Starting with the first paragraph, the user is laying out the problem and considering both Special Relativity (SR) and General Relativity (GR). The key points here are the formulas for time dilation and gravitational effects. So, the mentions of the Lorentz factor and the opposition of SR and GR effects are important.

In the second paragraph, the user discusses the SR time dilation formula and the approximation for small velocities. The formula for Δτ ≈ t * v²/(2c²) is essential here. Also, the mention of gravitational potential difference and the approximation using gh/c² for GR effect should be kept.

Third paragraph: The user is clarifying the total fractional time difference as a combination of SR and GR. The key formula Δτ_total = (gh - v²/2)/c² is critical. This formula combines both effects and is vital for the final calculation.

Fourth paragraph involves plugging in numbers for g, h, v, and c. The calculations here, like g h ≈ 2.94e6 and v²/2 ≈30,569,072, are necessary steps to find the numerator for the time difference. These numerical values are essential to retain.

The next paragraphs go into detailed calculations and checks against the measured result. The user compares their computed GR effect (≈34.24 ps/s) with the given 35.0 ps/s and discusses potential discrepancies due to approximations. The key takeaway is the combination of SR and GR effects leading to the net time loss, which is close to the measured value. This part shows the validation step, which is crucial.

In later paragraphs, precise recalculations using Earth's parameters and orbital mechanics reinforce the accuracy of the result. The final computation steps showing the exact value of -294.8 ps/s, rounding to -295 ps/s, and comparing it to the measured result are critical conclusions that need to be highlighted.

Throughout the trace, the main formulas, numerical substitutions, and the final comparison with the measured result are the most important elements. These parts ensure that the reasoning path is clear and that the essential steps leading to the conclusion are preserved.
