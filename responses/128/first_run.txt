Alright, I need to determine which parts of the existing reasoning are essential for future steps. The user's task is to figure out B/G for "guts round" hits on Bing and Google from 2011. Let's go through the thought process step by step.

First, the problem statement defines G and B, and the score formula. These are crucial for understanding the task, so they should be kept. The initial thoughts about historical data and the challenges of accessing 2011 info are important context but might be too lengthy. 

Considering the exploration of what "guts round" means and its possible contexts, this helps narrow down the term's usage, which is essential for understanding why certain hit counts might be relevant. Mentions of MIT Mystery Hunt, Carnegie Mellon competitions, and other academic references are key because they indicate the term's niche use, affecting search results.

The discussion about Wayback Machine and search engine dynamics is relevant because it explains why current data isn't helpful and the need for historical snapshots. However, parts of this could be summarized. The speculation about Bing's market share in 2011 versus Google's larger index is critical as it directly impacts the ratio estimation.

The analysis of the scoring formula is vital because it dictates how accurate the answer needs to be. This mathematical breakdown must be kept. The various guesses (0.1, 0.05, etc.) and reasoning behind them, including comparisons to current data, are essential for the final answer selection.

The conclusion where the user settles on 0.1 after considering different factors (Bing's smaller index, historical context) is the pivotal point, so those parts need to be preserved. The final answer box is obviously crucial.

Now, I'll identify the exact sentences and phrases that capture these essential elements, ensuring they are wrapped in <keep> tags. Each block should be a complete thought or critical data point. Since the user specified at least 24 blocks, I'll break down longer paragraphs into their key sentences to meet this requirement without redundancy.
</think>

- Paragraph 1, Sentence 1: <keep>Determine $B / G$. Your score will be $$\max (0,\left\lfloor 20\left(1-\frac{20|a-k|}{k}\right)\right\rfloor)$$ where $k$ is the actual answer and $a$ is your answer.</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 2: <keep>I think it's a type of competition format, maybe in math or academic competitions, where teams solve problems quickly?</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 3: <keep>Unless someone explicitly searched for "guts round" on that date and saved the page, which is unlikely.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 1: <keep>Wait, what if "guts round" is part of a specific competition, like the MIT Mystery Hunt or another puzzle competition?</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 3: <keep>The MIT Mystery Hunt typically happens in January, so October 31 doesn't align with that.</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 2: <keep>Now, in general, Google usually has more indexed pages than Bing, so B/G might be less than 1.</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 4: <keep>Their index was different in 2011?</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 2: <keep>The term 20|a -k| /k is the relative error multiplied by 20. If that exceeds 1, the score is zero.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 2: <keep>But since I can't do time travel, perhaps the problem is referencing a particular instance or joke.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 1: <keep>Wait, if both G and B are zero, then B/G would be undefined, but if either is zero, the ratio is zero or undefined.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 4: <keep>Therefore, "guts round" must have had some hits on both engines as of that date.</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 3: <keep>So in 2011, the hit count for "guts round" would have been some number, but we can't go back in time to check.</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 1: <keep>Looking now, it seems "guts round" is a term used in certain academic competitions, like math competitions, where teams solve a set of problems quickly.</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 3: <keep>If current Bing hits with the exact phrase are around 1,060 and Google at 23,200, the ratio is ~0.0457, but maybe in 2011, before some competitions popularized the term, the numbers would have been lower, but with a similar ratio?</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 1: <keep>Given that, since I can't access historical data, and given that the contest is probably from 2011 or 2012, maybe this problem was posed when the data was current.</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 3: <wait, here's a thought. If this problem was posed in 2011, soon after the specified date, the participants might have been instructed to search "guts round" right then and check the hit counts.</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentence 2: <keep>According to some sources from that time, Google's index was estimated to be over 1 trillion pages, while Bing's index was around 1/10th of that.</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentence 3: <keep>Assuming that Bing had roughly 1/10th of Google's index, then perhaps the number of hits for "guts round" would also be roughly 1/10th. Thus, B/G â‰ˆ 0.1.</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 1: <keep>Given all that, since I can't access historical hit counts, and the term "guts round" is not extremely common, maybe the ratio is a small fraction.</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 3: <keep>If I had to make an educated guess, based on current data having a ratio of ~0.05, and considering that in 2011 Bing's index was smaller relative to Google's than today (maybe more like 0.1 to 0.2), then back then maybe B/G was higher.</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 4: <keep>Therefore, around 0.1 to 0.2. So perhaps k=0.1.</keep>
- Paragraph 14, Sentence 2: <keep>But as I have to choose, and considering it's 2011,the year Microsoft and Bing were still catching up, but even so, maybe the answer is 1/20=0.05.</keep>
- Paragraph 15, Sentence 3: <keep>Therefore, regardless, if I have to choose a number, and considering modern data is B/G ~0.045, but in 2011, possibly more. Given that, I can hypothesize it's approximately 0.1. So \boxed{0.1}</keep>
- Paragraph 15, Sentence 4: <keep>\boxed{0.1}</keep>
