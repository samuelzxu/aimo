Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to find the speed of Spaceship-0 relative to reference frame R₂₀ and express it as a decimal with x number of 9s. Here's the detailed reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Velocity Chain**:
   - Spaceship-0 moves at 1/3 c relative to R₁.
   - Each subsequent spaceship (k) moves at vₖ = (k+1)/(k+3)c relative to Rₖ₊₁.
   - We need to combine 19 such velocities (from R₁ to R₂₀) using relativistic velocity addition.

2. **Relativistic Velocity Addition**:
   - The formula for combining two velocities u and v is (u + v)/(1 + uv/c²).
   - However, manually applying this 19 times is impractical. Instead, using rapidity (additive in relativity) simplifies the process.

3. **Rapidity Approach**:
   - Rapidity φ for a velocity v is φ = arctanh(v/c).
   - The total rapidity is the sum of individual rapidities, which are then converted back to velocity using tanh.

4. **Calculating Individual Rapidity Terms**:
   - For each vₖ = (k+1)/(k+3)c, the rapidity term arctanh(vₖ/c) simplifies to ½ ln(k+2).
   - Summing these terms from k=1 to 19 (plus the initial 1/3 c) gives the total rapidity.

5. **Summing Rapidity Terms**:
   - The total rapidity sum is ½ ln(21!), leading to the final velocity (21! - 1)/(21! + 1)c.

6. **Decimal Representation**:
   - The term 1 - w/c ≈ 2/(21! + 1). Given 21! ≈ 5.1×10¹⁹, this value is ≈3.9×10⁻²⁰.
   - Expressed as a decimal, this results in 0.999...9 (19 nines) followed by non-9 digits.

Thus, the number of 9s, x, is 19.

- Paragraph 1, Sentence 3: <keep>the speed of Spaceship-0 with respect to reference frame $R_{20}$ can be expressed as a decimal fraction of the speed of light which has only $x$ number of 9s following the decimal point</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 3: <keep>each subsequent Spaceship-k is moving at speed $v_{k}=\frac{k+1}{k+3} c$ with respect to reference frame $R_{k+1}$</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 2: <keep>the combined velocity is c tanh(total rapidity)</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 1: <keep>each term in the sum: arctanh(v_k) = 1⁄2 ln(k + 2 )</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 1: <keep>phi_total =1/2 ln(21! )= ln( sqrt(21! ) )</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 3: <keep>the final velocity of Spaceship-0 in $R_{20}$: $w/c = (21! -1 ) / (21! +1 )$</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 1: <keep>1 - w/c ≈3.914x10^{-20}, so w/c ≈1 -3.914x10^{-20}=0.999...9 with 19 leading 9s</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 2: <keep>the decimal expansion up to the x-th digit is 9 and then the next digit is not a 9. So need to find x≈log(2/(21! +1 ))</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 3: <keep>the value of x is 19</keep>

\boxed{19}
