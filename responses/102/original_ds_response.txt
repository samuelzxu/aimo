Okay, so I need to evaluate the infinite series sum from n=2 to infinity of (3n2 + 3n +1)/(n2 +n)3. And then express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n. Alright, let's start breaking this down.

First, let's rewrite the general term of the series: for each n starting at 2, the term is (3n2 + 3n +1)/(n2 +n)3. Hmm, the denominator is (n2 +n) cubed. Let me see if I can factor that or simplify it. n2 +n is n(n +1). So the denominator becomes [n(n +1)]3 = n3(n +1)3. So, denominator is n3(n +1)3. The numerator is 3n2 +3n +1. Hmm.

So the term is (3n2 +3n +1) / [n3(n +1)3]. Not sure if that helps yet. Maybe I should look for telescoping series techniques here? Since telescoping series are common in these kinds of problems, especially when dealing with fractions that can be broken down into partial fractions that cancel out terms when summed.

To check if this is telescoping, I need to think about how the numerator and denominator relate. The denominator is n3(n+1)^3. The numerator is a quadratic. Let's see:

Wait, perhaps we can express the general term as a difference of terms that cancel when summed. Let me consider writing (3n2 +3n +1) / [n3(n +1)3] as some expression involving 1/n2 and 1/(n+1)^2 or similar. Perhaps a difference of fractions.

Another approach is to look for a telescoping series by considering the general term as a difference between consecutive terms in some sequence. Let me think if there's a way to decompose this.

Let me note that if the denominator is [n(n+1)]3, and the numerator is 3n2 +3n +1. Let me consider derivatives or telescoping differences. Alternatively, maybe partial fractions.

Alternatively, note that 3n2 +3n +1 resembles (n+1)^3 -n^3. Let's compute (n +1)^3 -n^3:

(n +1)^3 -n^3 = 3n2 +3n +1. Wait! That's exactly the numerator. So that's a key insight. So the numerator here is (n +1)^3 -n^3. Therefore, the term becomes [(n +1)^3 -n^3] / [n3(n +1)3].

Let me write that again: [(n +1)^3 - n3] divided by [n3(n +1)^3]. So that can be split into two terms: (n +1)^3 / [n3(n +1)^3] - n3 / [n3(n +1)^3]. Simplifying each term:

First term: (n +1)^3 / [n3(n +1)^3] = 1/n3

Second term: n3 / [n3(n +1)^3] = 1/(n +1)^3

Therefore, the general term simplifies to 1/n3 - 1/(n +1)^3. Wait, that's neat! So the original term (3n2 +3n +1)/[n2(n+1)^2]3 is actually equal to 1/n3 -1/(n+1)^3. Wait, but let me verify:

Numerator: (n+1)^3 -n^3 = 3n2 +3n +1, correct.

Denominator: n3(n +1)^3

So, [(n+1)^3 -n^3] / [n3(n +1)^3] = (n+1)^3/[n3(n +1)^3] -n^3/[n3(n +1)^3] = 1/n3 -1/(n +1)^3. Yes, that's correct. So our series sum from n=2 to ∞ of [3n2 +3n +1]/[n(n +1)]3 is the same as sum from n=2 to ∞ of [1/n3 -1/(n+1)3]. That's a telescoping series!

Great! That simplifies the problem a lot. So if we have sum from n=2 to ∞ of [1/n3 -1/(n+1)3], this telescopes. Let's see:

The telescoping series starts at n=2, so the first term is 1/23 -1/33, the next term is 1/33 -1/43, and so on. All the intermediate terms cancel, leaving just the first term of the first expression and the limit of the last term as n approaches infinity. So, when we sum an infinite telescoping series like this, the sum equals the first term in the series minus the limit as n approaches infinity of 1/(n+1)^3.

So, the sum S = [1/23 - lim_{n→∞} 1/(n+1)3] = 1/8 - 0 = 1/8. But wait, is that correct? Wait, hold on.

Wait, the general term is 1/n3 - 1/(n+1)^3. When we sum from n=2 to infinity, the partial sum up to N would be [1/23 -1/33] + [1/33 -1/43] + ... + [1/N3 -1/(N +1)^3]. So when we sum from n=2 to N, the total sum is 1/23 -1/(N +1)^3. Then, taking the limit as N approaches infinity, 1/(N+1)^3 goes to 0, so the sum is 1/23 =1/8. Wait, so S= 1/8? But that seems perhaps too straightforward. Let me verify again.

Yes, the telescoping works like that. If each term cancels with the previous term, the series telescopes down to the initial term of the first expression minus the limit of the last term as N approaches infinity. Since this limit is 0, the sum is 1/8. Therefore, the answer is 1/8, which can be written as 1/8 where m=1 and n=8, so m +n=9.

Wait, that seems quite simple. But wait a minute, the question starts the sum at n=2. So is this the correct result? Let me cross-verify.

If we denote the telescoping series sum_{n=2}^infty [1/n3 -1/(n+1)^3], then the sum is indeed 1/23 - lim_{n->infty} 1/(n+1)^3 = 1/8 -0=1/8. Alternatively, you could notice that the sum from n=1 to infinity of [1/n3 -1/(n+1)^3] is 1/13 - lim_{n->infty}1/(n+1)^3=1 -0=1. However, here our sum starts at n=2, so we can compute it as sum from n=1 to infinity minus the n=1 term.

Sum from n=1 to infinity is 1, as above. The term at n=1 is [1/13 -1/23] =1 -1/8=7/8. Therefore, sum from n=2 to infinity is 1 -7/8=1/8. Same result. Therefore, correct.

Therefore, the sum is 1/8, so m=1 and n=8, which are coprime. Then m +n=9.

Wait, but hold on. Let me verify again step by step.

First step, rewrite numerator as (n +1)^3 -n^3. Check:

(n +1)^3 -n^3 =n3 +3n2 +3n +1 -n3=3n2 +3n +1. Correct. So that allows us to write the numerator as the difference of two cubes, hence splitting the term into 1/n3 -1/(n +1)^3. That's a legitimate step.

Then, summing from n=2 to infinity, telescopes as per telescoping series.

Sum_{n=2}^∞ [1/n3 -1/(n +1)^3] = [1/23 -1/33] +[1/33 -1/43] +... So, as mentioned, all intermediate terms cancel. Therefore, the sum telescopes to 1/23 - lim_{N->infty}1/(N +1)^3=1/8 -0=1/8.

So yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, as I mentioned, another method would be to note that sum from n=1 to infinity[1/n3 -1/(n +1)^3] =1. So subtract the n=1 term: [1/13 -1/23]=1 -1/8=7/8. Therefore, total sum from n=2 is 1 -7/8=1/8. So that's consistent.

Therefore, seems correct, the sum is 1/8.

Therefore, m=1, n=8, m/n=1/8, so m +n=9.

Hence, the answer is 9.

But wait, let me check once more to avoid embarrassment. Did I make an error in the partial fractions?

Wait, let me write the term again:

Term given is (3n2 +3n +1)/[n(n +1)]3. We see that 3n2 +3n +1 is (n +1)^3 -n^3. Therefore:

(n +1)^3 -n^3 =3n2 +3n +1.

Dividing by [n(n +1)]3 gives:

[(n +1)^3 -n^3]/[n(n +1)]3= (n +1)^3/[n3(n +1)^3] -n^3/[n3(n +1)^3] =1/n3 -1/(n +1)^3. So, that splitting is correct.

Therefore, when adding from n=2 to infinity, terms beyond n=2: each -1/(n +1)^3 cancels with the next term's +1/(n +1)^3.

But in the partial sum, starting at n=2:

First term (n=2) gives 1/8 -1/27

Second term (n=3):1/27 -1/64

Third term (n=4):1/64 -1/125

And so on, each negative fraction cancels with the next positive fraction. Therefore, when summed to infinity, the sum telescopes to 1/8 minus the limit as n approaches infinity of 1/(n +1)^3, which is 0. Thus, sum is 1/8. So all checks out.

Therefore, answer is 1/8, m+n=1+8=9. So, I think the conclusion is correct.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{9}
