Alright, let's figure out which parts of the reasoning are essential to keep for future steps.

First, the key insight is recognizing that the numerator 3n² + 3n +1 is equal to (n+1)³ - n³. This allows splitting the term into a telescoping series. That part is crucial, so the explanation around that needs to be kept.

Next, breaking down the general term into 1/n³ -1/(n+1)³ is fundamental. This step shows how the series telescopes, so those sentences are important.

Then, evaluating the telescoping series by considering the partial sums starting from n=2 and how the terms cancel out, leaving only the first term. The verification using both starting at n=2 and subtracting the n=1 term reinforces the result, so those parts should be kept.

Finally, concluding the sum equals 1/8 and thus m+n=9 is the result, so that final step is essential.

Each of these steps is necessary for understanding how the series telescopes and why the sum is 1/8. Keeping these parts ensures that any future steps can refer back to the critical insights without rederiving them.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 3: <keep>the numerator is 3n2 +3n +1. The denominator is [n(n +1)]3 = n3(n +1)3.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 2: <keep>the numerator here is (n +1)^3 -n^3. Therefore, the term becomes [(n +1)^3 -n^3] / [n3(n +1)3].</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentences 5-6: <keep>[(n+1)^3 -n^3] / [n3(n +1)^3] = (n+1)^3/[n3(n +1)^3] -n^3/[n3(n +1)^3] = 1/n3 -1/(n +1)^3. Yes, that's correct.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentences 1-2: <keep>sum from n=2 to ∞ of [1/n3 -1/(n+1)3]. That's a telescoping series!</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentences 5-6: <keep>the sum S = [1/23 - lim_{n→∞} 1/(n+1)^3] = 1/8 - 0 = 1/8.</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentences 1-3: <keep>sum from n=1 to infinity of [1/n3 -1/(n+1)^3] is 1. However, here our sum starts at n=2, so we can compute it as sum from n=1 to infinity minus the n=1 term.</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 4: <keep>sum from n=2 to infinity is 1 -7/8=1/8. Same result.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentences 1-3: <keep>3n2 +3n +1 is (n +1)^3 -n^3. Therefore: (n +1)^3 -n^3 =3n2 +3n +1. Correct.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentences 7-8: <keep>sum telescopes to 1/8 minus the limit as n approaches infinity of 1/(n +1)^3, which is 0. Thus, sum is 1/8.</keep>
