Okay, let's try to figure out which parts are essential here. The problem is to find the remainder when a big product of numbers made up of 9's is divided by 1000. The thinking process uses modulo 8 and 125, then applies the Chinese Remainder Theorem. 

First, the key steps are breaking down the problem into modulo 8 and 125. For modulo 8, the analysis shows each term after the second contributes -1, leading to a result of 5 mod 8. For modulo 125, a similar process leads to 109 mod 125. Then, combining these gives 109 mod 1000.

The critical points here are:
- Recognizing each term is 10^k -1.
- Realizing modulo 8 and 125 separation.
- Calculations showing terms beyond k=3 are -1 mod 8 and 125.
- The number of such terms (997) leading to multiplying by (-1)^997.
- Solving the congruence with Chinese Remainder Theorem.

Essential tokens would be the steps where the user identifies the form of each term as 10^k -1, computes mod 8 and 125 separately, the count of terms, the CRT solution, and verification steps. Specific sentences where these calculations are detailed need to be marked. Also, the conclusion steps where they reconcile both mod results to get 109 mod 1000.
