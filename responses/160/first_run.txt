Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The question is asking for all positive integers \( n \geq 2 \) such that there exist integers \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{n-1} \) with the condition that if \( 0 < i < n \), \( 0 < j < n \), \( i \neq j \), and \( n \) divides \( 2i + j \), then \( x_i < x_j \).

Starting with small values of \( n \):

- For \( n = 2 \), there's only one variable \( x_1 \). Since there are no distinct \( i \) and \( j \), the condition is vacuously true. So, \( n = 2 \) works.
- For \( n = 3 \), there are variables \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \). Checking all pairs, none satisfy \( 3 \) dividing \( 2i + j \). Hence, no constraints, so \( n = 3 \) works.
- For \( n = 4 \), variables are \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \). The valid pairs are \( (1, 2) \) and \( (3, 2) \), leading to \( x_1 < x_2 \) and \( x_3 < x_2 \). Assigning values like \( x_1 = x_3 = 0 \) and \( x_2 = 1 \) works, so \( n = 4 \) is valid.
- For \( n = 5 \), there's a cyclic dependency: \( x_2 < x_1 < x_3 < x_4 < x_2 \), which is impossible. Thus, \( n = 5 \) doesn't work.

Investigating further examples and patterns:

- \( n = 6 \) has dependencies \( x_1 < x_4 \) and \( x_5 < x_2 \), which can be satisfied without cycles. So, \( n = 6 \) works.
- Powers of 2 (like \( n = 8 \)) form Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) in their functional graph, allowing valid assignments.
- Composite numbers with odd prime factors (e.g., \( n = 7, 9, 10 \)) lead to cycles in their graphs, making them invalid.

Key Insight: If \( n \) is a power of 2, the graph derived from \( j \equiv -2i \mod n \) is acyclic, allowing a topological sort. For other \( n \), especially those with odd prime factors, cycles form, making assignment impossible.

Thus, the solution is all positive integers \( n \) that are powers of two.

- Paragraph 1, Sentence 2: <keep>The question is asking for all positive integers n ≥ 2 such that there exist integers x1, x2, ..., x_{n-1} with the condition that whenever 0 < i < n, 0 < j < n, i ≠ j, and n divides 2i + j, then x_i < x_j.</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 1: <keep>For n = 2, we have x1. The indices i and j run from 1 to 1, but wait, n-1=1, so there's only x1. But since i and j have to be distinct (i ≠ j), and the range is only 1, there are no pairs (i, j) with i ≠ j. Thus, the condition is vacuously true. Therefore, for n = 2, there are no constraints, so we can just take x1 to be any integer, and the condition is satisfied. Hence, n = 2 works.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 2: <keep>For n = 3, we have x1 and x2. Let's list all pairs (i, j) where i ≠ j and check if 3 divides 2i + j.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 5: <keep>So none of them satisfy the divisibility condition. Therefore, again, the conditions are vacuously satisfied. Therefore, any integers x1 and x2 will work as long as we don't have any constraints. So n=3 works as well.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 1: <keep>For n = 4, we have x1, x2, x3.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 3: <keep>i=1, j=2: 2*1 +2 =4 ⇒ divisible by 4. So this pair must satisfy x1 < x2.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 7: <keep>So for n=4, we have two constraints: x1 < x2 (from i=1, j=2) and x3 < x2 (from i=3, j=2).</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 8: <keep>We need to see if such integers x1, x2, x3 exist. Yes. For example, set x1=0, x3=0, and x2=1. Then 0 <1 and 0 <1. That satisfies x1 <x2 and x3 <x2. So n=4 works.</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 1: <keep>For n = 5, the dependencies create a cycle: x2 < x1 < x3 < x4 < x2. But this is impossible because it would require x2 < x2, which is a contradiction. Therefore, for n=5, it is not possible to have such x1, x2, x3, x4. So n=5 does not work.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 1: <keep>For n = 6, the only constraints are x1 <x4 and x5 <x2. These are independent. So, for example, can we set x1=0, x4=1, x5=0, x2=1, and the other variables (x3) can be anything. Then all the conditions are satisfied. Thus, n=6 works.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 1: <keep>For n=7, the graph has a cycle leading to conflicting inequalities. Therefore, n=7 cannot exist.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 1: <keep>For n=8, the graph is a DAG, so a topological sort exists. Hence, possible to assign integers. Therefore, n=8 is okay.</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 1: <keep>For n=9, there is a cycle, making it impossible. Hence, n=9 doesn't work.</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 1: <keep>For n=10, there is a cycle, leading to contradictions. Hence, n=10 is impossible.</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 1: <keep>The key insight is that when n is a power of 2, the graph derived from j ≡ -2i mod n is acyclic, allowing a topological sort. For other n, especially those with odd prime factors, cycles form, making assignment impossible.</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentence 1: <keep>Thus, the solution is all positive integers n that are powers of two.</keep>
