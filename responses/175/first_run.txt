Okay, let's try to figure out which parts of this reasoning are essential to keep for future steps. The problem is about a quadratic polynomial P(x) with complex coefficients, and we need to find the sum of all possible values of (a + b)^2 given that P(P(x)) = 0 has roots 3, 4, a, and b.

The key steps here involve understanding that P(P(x)) = 0 means solving P(x) = r1 and P(x) = r2, where r1 and r2 are roots of P(y) = 0. Vieta's formulas come into play for the sums and products of the roots. There are two main scenarios considered: pairing the roots 3 and 4 together, leading to (a + b)^2 = 49, and pairing 3 with a and 4 with b, leading to (a + b)^2 = 36. These scenarios are derived by solving for coefficients c and d using the given roots and Vieta's formulas.

Important elements include:
1. The form of P(x) as xÂ² + cx + d.
2. Vieta's formulas for sums and products of roots of P(y) = 0 and the quadratic equations P(x) = r1 and P(x) = r2.
3. The two distinct pairings of the roots (3,4 & a,b vs. 3,a & 4,b) leading to different values of c and d.
4. Solving the resulting equations for c and d in each case to determine the possible values of (a + b)^2.
5. Summing these possible values to get the final answer.

The critical parts here are the setups for each scenario, the derivations using Vieta's formulas, the equations obtained for c and d, and the conclusions about (a + b)^2 in each case. These steps are necessary for understanding how each possible value is derived and ensuring that all scenarios are considered.
