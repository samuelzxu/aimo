Okay, so I need to figure out which parts of the reasoning are essential to keep for future steps. Let me go through each paragraph step by step.

Paragraph 1: Introduces the problem setup. Mentions Serge and Lis's machines, S(i) as the probability sum, and the conditions S(2)=S(12)=1/2 S(7) with S(7)>0. The conclusion to prove is p1=p6 and q1=q6. These initial conditions are critical, especially the definitions of S(2), S(12), and S(7), so they should be kept.

Paragraph 2: Calculates S(2)=p1*q1 and S(12)=p6*q6. Lists pairs for S(7): (1,6), (2,5), etc. Writes S(7) as the sum of products. These equations are foundational, so keep these expressions.

Paragraph 3: Sets up the equations from given conditions. States p1*q1 = p6*q6 and 2*p1*q1 equals the sum for S(7). These equations are key to the proof, so they must be retained.

Paragraph 4: Rewrites the equation by grouping terms, noting symmetry. The breakdown into (p1q6 + p6q1) and other symmetric pairs might be important for applying inequalities like AM-GM. Keep this structure.

Paragraph 5: Suggests using differences a = p1-p6 and b = q1-q6 but shifts to considering Cauchy-Schwarz or AM-GM. The mention of AM-GM is crucial here as it leads to the inequality step.

Paragraph 6: Applies AM-GM to p1q6 + p6q1, showing it's at least 2p1q1. Points out equality condition (p1/p6=q1/q6). This step is essential for the proof, so keep the inequality and equality condition.

Paragraph 7: Connects the AM-GM result to the given equations, noting other terms must be zero since RHS can't exceed LHS. The conclusion that other terms (p2q5 etc.) must be zero is vital for forcing symmetry. Retain this reasoning.

Paragraph 8: Discusses the implication of other terms being zero and S(7)>0 leading to non-zero p1q6 + p6q1. Highlights contradiction if p6 or q6 is zero. This part is important to validate the non-zero probabilities, so keep it.

Paragraph 9: Introduces k = p1/p6 = q1/q6 and substitutes into equations, deriving k=1. This substitution and solving for k lead directly to p1=p6 and q1=q6. Keep the substitution and result.

Paragraph 10: Concludes that p1=p6 and q1=q6 by eliminating other possibilities, tying back to initial conditions. The final steps confirming the conclusion should be kept.

Each of these critical points (equations, inequality application, substitutions, conclusions) needs to be encapsulated within keep tags. Now, I'll list them with their paragraph and sentence numbers.
