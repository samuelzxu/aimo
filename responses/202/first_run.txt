Okay, let's see. The user wants me to identify the essential parts of the existing reasoning that need to be kept for future steps.

First, the problem is about finding the number of idempotent homomorphisms on the group A, which is a union of roots of unity of degrees 2006^k. The key steps in the reasoning were breaking down A into its primary components (Prüfer groups for primes 2, 17, 59), then realizing that endomorphisms decompose into components for each prime. Each component's endomorphism ring has only 0 and 1 as idempotents. So, for each of the three primes, there's a binary choice, leading to 2^3 =8 possibilities. 

Important points to keep:
- Decomposition of A into direct sum of Prüfer groups for primes 2,17,59.
- Endomorphism ring of each component has only 0 and 1 as idempotents.
- Therefore, each component contributes a binary choice, leading to 8 total.

So, identifying the sentences where these conclusions are stated.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 7: <keep>each End(Z(p^∞)) has only 0 and 1 as idempotents</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 5: <keep>the number of such idempotent endomorphisms is 2^3 = 8</keep>
