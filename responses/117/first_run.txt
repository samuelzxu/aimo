Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to compute the sum from k=2 to infinity of the fractional part of the Riemann zeta function at odd integers, specifically ζ(2k - 1). The fractional part {x} is defined as x minus the floor of x, which is the greatest integer less than or equal to x. 

First, I need to recall the definition of the Riemann zeta function: ζ(s) = sum_{n=1}^∞ 1/n^s for s > 1. Since we're dealing with ζ(2k - 1) where k starts at 2, the arguments are 3, 5, 7, etc. 

Knowing that ζ(s) approaches 1 as s increases because the terms 1/n^s get smaller, I realize that for large k, ζ(2k - 1) will be very close to 1. This means the fractional part {ζ(2k - 1)} would be ζ(2k - 1) - 1 if ζ(2k - 1) is between 1 and 2. Checking values like ζ(3) ≈ 1.202 and ζ(5) ≈ 1.036 confirms that these are indeed between 1 and 2, so their fractional parts are ζ(s) - 1.

Thus, the problem reduces to summing ζ(2k - 1) - 1 from k=2 to infinity. Breaking down ζ(2k - 1) into its series, we get ζ(2k - 1) = 1 + sum_{n=2}^∞ 1/n^{2k-1}. Subtracting 1 leaves us with sum_{n=2}^∞ 1/n^{2k-1}. 

By switching the order of summation (justified by Tonelli's theorem for non-negative terms), the double sum becomes sum_{n=2}^∞ sum_{k=2}^∞ 1/n^{2k-1}. Simplifying the inner sum using a geometric series approach, each term becomes 1/(n^3 - n) after partial fraction decomposition.

Decomposing 1/(n^3 - n) into partial fractions results in a telescoping series. The key steps involve recognizing that the divergent parts cancel out, leaving a finite sum. After careful cancellation, the remaining terms sum up to 1/4.

This approach efficiently navigates the properties of the zeta function, series manipulation, and partial fractions to arrive at the final result.
