Alright, let's go through this step by step. The user provided a complex problem set involving sparse sets, oracle machines, and angel classes. The task is to identify which parts of the reasoning are essential to keep for future steps. 

Starting with Problem 1: The key idea here is combining k sparse sets into one by tagging each element with its index. This ensures the resulting set remains sparse. The crucial part is the method of encoding (i, x) and verifying sparsity by counting the combined elements. This needs to be kept.

For Problem 2, understanding the difference between P_angel and P_bad-angel is vital. The insight here is that computable advice doesn't add power beyond P, hence P_bad-angel equals P. Similarly, contrasting this with NP, where unless P=NP, NP won't equal P_bad-angel. These comparisons are essential.

Problem 3 relates P_angel to sparse oracles. The main point is recognizing that P_angel is akin to P/poly, which can be represented by a sparse oracle. Citing the theorem that connects P/poly with sparse sets is critical here.

Now, looking at the detailed reasoning:

1. The method of encoding (i, x) for Problem 1 is fundamental. Keeping the explanation of how tagging preserves sparsity is necessary.
2. The conclusion about combining sparse sets into S by tagging with indexes is key.
3. For Problem 2, the equivalence of P_bad-angel and P due to computable advice is a core insight.
4. The reasoning about why NP doesn't equal P_bad-angel unless P=NP is crucial.
5. In Problem 3, the connection between P_angel and P/poly needs to be retained.
6. The idea that sparse oracles can encode advice strings is essential.

Each of these points forms a block that must be kept to ensure the reasoning can be followed without redundant information. The technical details about encoding lengths and sparsity checks are necessary but should be concise. Theorems and standard results (like P/poly equivalence) should be highlighted as they underpin the solution.

- Paragraph 6, Sentence 1: <keep>NP ≠ P_bad-angel unless NP = P, as angel strings lack nondeterministic capability</keep>
