Okay, let's break down the problem step by step. We need to find the ratio of distances DA/DB for two binary black hole systems that emit gravitational waves with the same strain amplitude and frequency. 

First, I recall that the strain amplitude (h) of gravitational waves depends on the chirp mass (Mc), distance (D), and frequency (f). The formula simplifies to h being proportional to Mc^(5/3) * f^(2/3) / D. Since the strain and frequency are the same for both systems, the ratio of distances will depend on the ratio of their chirp masses.

The chirp mass Mc is calculated using Mc = (m1 * m2)^(3/5) / (m1 + m2)^(1/5). For system A (masses 10 and 25), Mc,A is derived from (10*25)^(3/5) / 35^(1/5). For system B (masses 35 and 50), Mc,B comes from (35*50)^(3/5) / 85^(1/5).

Next, we compute the ratio Mc,A / Mc,B. Simplifying the expressions, we find that this ratio involves terms like 250^3/35 for system A and 1750^3/85 for system B. After simplifying the ratio, we find Mc,A / Mc,B ≈ 0.37.

Finally, the distance ratio DA/DB is (Mc,A / Mc,B)^(5/3). Plugging in 0.37 and raising it to the 5/3 power gives approximately 0.19, which corresponds to answer choice C.
