Alright, I need to determine which parts of the given reasoning are essential for future steps. The user's question is about identifying the values of n where all lamps will turn off eventually, regardless of initial configuration. The assistant's thought process involves analyzing small values of n, modeling the problem using linear algebra over GF(2), and considering nilpotency of matrices.

First, I'll look for key insights and conclusions that form the basis of the final answer. These include the initial analysis for small n (like n=1, 2, 3, 4), the transition to linear algebra modeling, and the conclusion about powers of two.

Important sections include:
- The rules interpretation for different n.
- The realization that n=1 works.
- The cycles observed for n=2, 3, 4.
- The shift to linear algebra over GF(2) and nilpotency.
- The connection to powers of two from referenced papers.
- The final conclusion despite initial contradictions.

Each critical step in these sections should be marked to preserve the logical flow and the crucial mathematical steps leading to the answer.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 3: <keep>A lamp is on at t+1 if and only if at minute t, exactly one of its neighbors is on (the two lamps at the ends have one neighbor each, all other lamps have two neighbors).</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 1: <keep>For which values of n can we guarantee that all lamps will be off after some time?</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 1: <keep>Case n = 1. If there's only one lamp, it has no neighbors.</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 6: <keep>Hence, the lamp will be off at next minute regardless of what it was before. Therefore, if n=1, the lamp's next state is always off.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 5: <keep>Therefore, OO maps to OO. That's a problem.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 7: <keep>Therefore, n=2 is not acceptable.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 1: <keep>Case n=3: Three lamps in a line.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 9: <keep>Therefore, the cycle is OOO -> O T O -> F O O -> O O O. Thus, it's a cycle of length 3.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 10: <keep>Therefore, n=3 is bad.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 1: <keep>Case n=4. Let's check if n=4 is good.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 17: <keep>Thus, t=5: F F F F. All lamps off.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 24: <keep>Therefore, n=4 is bad.</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 1: <keep>Given that the next state is determined by whether the number of on neighbors is exactly one.</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 3: <keep>over GF(2), the system's evolution is linear.</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 7: <keep>whether the matrix M is nilpotent over GF(2).</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 1: <keep>The matrix M would be tridiagonal with 1s on the super and subdiagonals.</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 7: <keep>If M^k = 0 for some k, then any initial state will reach zero after k steps.</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 1: <keep>Over GF(2), when you consider x_{t+1}=Mx_t, after k steps, you have x_{t+k}=M^k x_t.</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 7: <keep>Hence, the problem reduces to determining for which n the associated matrix is nilpotent.</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentence 5: <keep>Hence, the key is to check whether, for given n, the matrix M is nilpotent over GF(2).</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 3: <keep>In paper titled "Nilpotent cellular automata have the property that every configuration evolves to the zero configuration."</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 5: <keep>Nilpotency requires the size to be a power of two.</keep>
- Paragraph 14, Sentence 1: <keep>Final Answer: All positive integers that are powers of two. So the values of n are boxed{2^k} for some non-negative integer k.</keep>
- Paragraph 15, Sentence 1: <keep>But in initial observations, some n=4 can cycle, but over GF(2), the system ultimately terminates.</keep>
- Paragraph 15, Sentence 3: <keep>According to Sutner's paper, nilpotency requires n to be powers of two.</keep>
- Paragraph 16, Sentence 1: <keep>Final Answer: The values of n that are powers of two. So the answer is boxed{2^k} for non-negative integers k.</keep>
