Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user is asking me to determine which tokens in the provided reasoning are essential for future steps. I need to go through each part of the reasoning and identify key points that are crucial for deriving the final answer. 

First, the problem is about estimating the maximum height of a mountain on a charged Earth. The key factors here are the tensile strength of rock, the gravitational force, and the electric force due to the charge. The reasoning starts by setting up the basic physics concepts involved, like tensile strength and electric fields.

The user discusses how the Earth's charge creates a surface charge density, which leads to an electric field. This electric field generates a repulsive force that counteracts gravity. The stress at the base of the mountain must not exceed the tensile strength. This part is critical because it establishes the relationship between the forces and the stress limit.

Next, the reasoning dives into the geometry of the mountain, considering it as a spherical sector. The volume calculation is important here because it affects the gravitational force. The discussion about approximating the volume for different shapes (cylinder, cone, spherical cap) is necessary to understand how the stress is calculated based on the mountain's shape.

The calculation of the electric force involves surface charge density and the resulting electric field. The key equations here are the surface charge density formula and the electric pressure on the conductor. These equations are essential for determining the upward electric force.

The user then computes the numerical values for these forces, comparing the electric stress to the tensile strength. Despite the large charge, the electric stress turns out to be much smaller than the tensile strength, leading to the conclusion that the electric effect is negligible. This conclusion is vital because it justifies ignoring the electric contribution in the final calculation.

Throughout the reasoning, the user repeatedly refers to the key parameters: Q (charge), tensile strength, density of rock, and gravitational acceleration. These parameters are essential for the final formula. The derivation of the maximum height using the formula h_max = S / (ρg) after considering the negligible electric contribution is the critical step that leads to the answer.

The confusion about the mountain's geometry and the different volume formulas shows that the shape's impact on stress is considered, but ultimately, the cylindrical approximation is used for simplicity. The final calculation using the tensile strength and gravitational acceleration to find h_max is the culmination of all these steps.

In summary, the essential parts include the setup of the problem with charge and tensile strength, the force calculations (both gravitational and electric), the comparison showing electric effect is negligible, and the final formula application. These sections contain the necessary equations, parameter values, and logical steps needed to arrive at the answer.
