Okay, let's try to figure out which parts of the reasoning are essential to keep for future steps. The main goal is to compare b and c given the equation and a < b.

First, the user tried factoring the equation but found it complex. Then, they noticed the equation is homogeneous, leading to substituting variables t = a/b and s = c/b. This substitution simplifies the equation by factoring out b³. The transformed equation in terms of t and s is crucial, as it reduces variables and focuses on comparing s (c/b) to 1.

Key steps here are the substitution process and deriving the equation 2t³ + 2s³ -6t² +3t -1 -3ts² -3s² +6ts = 0. This equation's analysis shows that s=1 leads to t=1 (contradiction since a < b), suggesting s must deviate from 1. Testing specific cases (a=0, a=b/2) consistently results in s >1, implying c > b.

The core argument is the substitution method and analyzing the cubic equation for s, showing s must exceed 1. Final conclusion hinges on proving the real root for s >1 given t <1, using intermediate value theorem and behavior of the cubic function.
