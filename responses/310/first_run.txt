Okay, so the user wants me to identify the essential tokens in the given reasoning trace for the physics problem. Let me start by understanding the problem and the existing solution.

The question is about a planet's speed at two different points in its elliptical orbit. The key here is using the vis-viva equation, which relates the speed of a planet to its distance from the star. The steps involve calculating the distances at the two points (perigee and point P), plugging them into the vis-viva equation, and finding the ratio of the speeds.

Looking at the thought process, the critical parts would be:

1. Determining the eccentricity of the orbit since it's needed for calculating distances.
2. Using the vis-viva equation for both points.
3. Calculating the ratio of the velocities using those equations.

The thought process goes through finding the eccentricity (e=0.5) using the given perigee distance. Then, calculating the distance at point P using the polar form of the ellipse equation. Then applying the vis-viva equation for both points.

The key formulas and values here are:

- The vis-viva equation: v² = GM(2/r - 1/a)
- The distances: r_peri = 0.5a and r_P = 0.75a
- The ratio calculation leading to 3/sqrt(5)

I need to ensure these critical steps and formulas are marked as essential. Also, the conclusion that the answer is option A should be kept.

Now, looking at the original text, paragraphs where these calculations are explained should be tagged. For example, where eccentricity is calculated, where r_P is determined, the application of the vis-viva equation, and the final ratio computation.

Need to make sure each essential step is wrapped in <keep> tags. Let me go through the text step by step.

In the first few paragraphs, the user calculates the semi-major axis and apogee. That's important for setting up the problem. Then, when they use the vis-viva equation and compute the velocities at both points, those parts are crucial. The final ratio calculation and conclusion are also essential.

Also, the part where they derive the distance at point P using polar coordinates and theta=pi/2 is vital because that's how r_P is found.

I need to tag the sentences where these key formulas and results are mentioned. For example:

- The paragraph where e=0.5 is determined.
- The calculation of r_P as 0.75a.
- The vis-viva equations for v1 and v2.
- The ratio computation leading to 3/sqrt(5).

Also, the final answer boxed should be kept.

Make sure not to miss these parts. Let me count to ensure at least 14 blocks. Each major step (like each formula, key calculation) would be a block. Probably need to mark each of the key equations and their substitutions.

- Paragraph 1, Sentence 1: <keep>A planet orbits around a star S, as shown in the figure. The semi-major axis of the orbit is a. The perigee, namely the shortest distance between the planet and the star is 0.5a.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 1: <keep>First, let's recall some properties of elliptical orbits. The semi-major axis is a, which is the average of the maximum and minimum distances from the star.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 3: <keep>So, the semi-major axis a is (perigee + apogee)/2. If the perigee is 0.5a, then:</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 5: <keep>2a = 0.5a + apogee</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 6: <keep>Apogee = 2a - 0.5a = 1.5a</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 3: <keep>So the orbit has a semi-major axis of a, with periastron at 0.5a and apastron at 1.5a.</keep>
- Paragraph 14, Sentence 1: <keep>Given that the periastron is 0.5a, apastron must be 1.5a, since a = (0.5a + 1.5a)/2 = (2a)/2 = a.</keep>
- Paragraph 14, Sentence 2: <keep>So the center is at ( (0.5a +1.5a)/2, 0 ) = (1.0a, 0).</keep>
- Paragraph 17, Sentence 1: <keep>Given that, if periastron is 0.5a, then 1 - e = 0.5 => e=0.5 as before.</keep>
- Paragraph 20, Sentence 1: <keep>The equation of an ellipse in polar coordinates with one focus at the origin is r = (a (1 - e^2)) / (1 + e cos θ).</keep>
- Paragraph 20, Sentence 3: <keep>Then, when θ = 90 degrees (π/2), the point is at (r, θ) = (0.75a / (1 + 0.5 * 0), so 0.75a /1 = 0.75a). Therefore, the distance from the star to point P is 0.75a.</keep>
- Paragraph 21, Sentence 1: <keep>Using the vis-viva equation, the speed at point P, v1, is given by v1^2 = G M (2 / r_P - 1 / a). Similarly, the speed at periastron (distance r_peri = 0.5a) is v2, so v2^2 = G M (2 / r_peri - 1/a )</keep>
- Paragraph 21, Sentence 4: <keep>Therefore, the ratio v2 / v1 = sqrt( (3/a ) / (5/3 /a ) ) = sqrt( (3)/(5/3) ) = sqrt(9/5) = 3/sqrt(5)</keep>
- Paragraph 27, Sentence 1: <keep>\boxed{A}</keep>
