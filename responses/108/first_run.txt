Okay, let's go through the problem and the provided solution to identify the essential tokens for future reasoning steps. 

**Question Analysis:**
The problem has two parts. Part (a) involves computing the S-transform (which is a Fourier transform with a sign change in the exponent) for two functions: \( \frac{1}{1+x^2} \) and \( \frac{1}{(1+x^2)^2} \). Part (b) requires finding constants \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) such that the S-transform of \( f_k(x) = (1+x^2)^{-1-k} \) satisfies a specific second-order ODE.

**Key Steps in the Thought Process:**

For part (a):
1. Recognizing that the S-transform is related to the Fourier transform.
2. Using contour integration to compute the integral for \( \frac{1}{1+x^2} \), leading to an exponential function.
3. For \( \frac{1}{(1+x^2)^2} \), using convolution or residue theorem, resulting in an expression involving both an exponential and a polynomial term.

For part (b):
1. Recognizing that the S-transform of \( f_k \) must satisfy an ODE.
2. Relating derivatives of the S-transform to the original function using properties of Fourier transforms.
3. Deriving the ODE by substituting these relations and solving for constants \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \).

**Identifying Essential Tokens:**
1. **Fourier Transform Identification:** The S-transform is essentially a Fourier transform with a sign convention. This is crucial for applying known Fourier transform results.
2. **Residue Calculations:** The steps involving contour integration and residues for poles at \( u = i \) and \( u = -i \) are critical for evaluating the integrals in part (a).
3. **Convolution Approach:** The use of convolution to handle the square of the function's Fourier transform is key for part (a).
4. **Differential Equations:** The differential equation satisfied by \( f_k(x) \) and its transformation into the ODE for \( y = S(f_k)(x) \) is fundamental for part (b).
5. **Recursive Relations:** The relationship between \( S(f_{k-1}) \) and \( S(f_k) \) via the ODE derivation is essential for determining the constants.
