Okay, so the problem involves a triangle ABC with various points and parallel lines, and we need to find the ratio of the areas of triangle PQR to ABC. The initial approach uses coordinate geometry to assign coordinates to the vertices and compute the necessary points through parametric equations and vector analysis. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Assign Coordinates**: A is at (0,0), B at (8,0), and C is parametrized as (x,y).
2. **Find Points D and E**: Using section formulas based on given ratios (CD:DB=2:5 and EA:EC=3:1).
3. **Parametric Equations for AD and BE**: Setting up equations for lines AD and BE to find their intersection P.
4. **Solve for Intersection P**: By equating parametric equations and solving for parameters t and s, leading to coordinates of P.
5. **Determine Q and R**: Using parallelism conditions (PQ || CA, PR || CB) to find coordinates of Q and R on AB.
6. **Calculate Areas**: Using base and height for both triangles PQR and ABC, leading to the ratio 225/676.
7. **Verification**: Check with specific coordinates and confirm the ratio remains consistent.

Key tokens to retain involve the coordinates of points P, Q, R, and the area ratio calculation. These steps are crucial as they form the backbone of the coordinate geometry approach, ensuring the calculations are consistent and verifying the ratio through multiple methods.
