Okay, let me try to figure out which parts of the reasoning are essential to keep for future steps. The problem involves trains passing cyclists, relative speeds, and solving equations. The key steps are:

1. Setting up equations for the time each train takes to pass Jon, leading to the relation v_e - v_w = 40.
2. Setting up the equation for the times the trains take to pass Steve, which leads to solving for the speeds of the trains.
3. Calculating the length of the train using the found speeds.

Critical tokens are those that establish the equations (like L/(v_e - 20) = 1/60 and L/(v_w - 20) = 10 * L/(v_e + 20)), the relation between v_e and v_w, the solved speeds, and the final calculation of L. 

Looking at the original reasoning, the key parts include:

- The two equations from passing Jon.
- The substitution of v_e in terms of v_w.
- The equation for Steve's case and solving for v_w.
- Calculating L using both equations to verify consistency.
- The conclusion that L is 22/27 and m+n=49.

These parts are necessary for future reasoning as they contain the core equations and their solutions. The verification steps also ensure correctness, so including the check of relative speeds and times with Steve solidifies the solution's validity.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 5: <keep>Length of each train is L (miles). We need to find L. Speed of the eastbound train as v_e (mph). Speed of the westbound train as v_w (mph).</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 9: <keep>L / (v_e - 20) = 1/60 hours. Similarly, for the westbound train passing Jon, since it's moving west and Jon is moving east, their relative speed is v_w + 20 mph. Therefore, the time to pass Jon would be L / (v_w + 20) = 1/60 hours.</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 11: <keep>v_e - 20 = v_w + 20 => v_e - v_w = 40. So, we have the relationship between v_e and v_w as v_e = v_w + 40.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 3: <keep>L / (v_w - 20) = 10 * (L / (v_e + 20))</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 5: <keep>replace v_e with (v_w + 40)</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 7: <keep>1 / (v_w - 20) = 10 / (v_w + 60)</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 9: <keep>(v_w + 60) = 10 (v_w - 20)</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 11: <keep>v_w = 260 / 9 ≈ 28.888... mph</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 13: <keep>v_e = 620/9 ≈ 68.888... mph</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 2: <keep>L = (v_e - 20)/60</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 5: <keep>22/27 miles. So the length is 22/27</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 6: <keep>m is 22 and n is 27, so m + n = 22 + 27 = 49</keep>
