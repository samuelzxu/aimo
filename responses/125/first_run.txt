Okay, so I need to figure out how many distinguishable arrangements Robert can make with his 4 gold and 4 silver coins, ensuring no two adjacent coins are face to face. Let me start by breaking down the problem.

First, each coin, whether gold or silver, has an engraving on one side. When stacking them, the rule is that no two adjacent coins can have their engraved sides touching. That means if one coin is placed with the engraved side up (E), the next coin can't be placed with the engraved side down (N) because that would make their touching sides both engraved.

Hmm, so the orientation of each coin matters. Let's think in terms of sequences. If a coin is E, its top is engraved, and its bottom isn't. If it's N, the top isn't engraved, but the bottom is. The key is that adjacent coins can't have E followed by N because that would cause engraved sides to touch.

Now, the coins are indistinct except for their type (gold or silver) and orientation. So, the problem involves two separate aspects: the arrangement of gold and silver coins and the orientation of each coin, with the constraint on orientations.

The number of ways to arrange 4 gold and 4 silver coins is the combination C(8,4) = 70. Then, for each of these arrangements, we need to count valid orientation sequences (E and N) of length 8 that avoid the substring "EN".

To find the number of valid orientation sequences, let's model it as a recurrence relation. Let a_n be sequences ending with E, and b_n be those ending with N. The recurrence is:
- a_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} (appending E to any valid sequence)
- b_n = b_{n-1} (appending N only to sequences ending with N)

Starting with a_1 = 1 (E), b_1 = 1 (N), the total for n=8 is 9. Therefore, the total arrangements are 70 * 9 = 630.
