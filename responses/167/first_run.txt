Okay, let me try to go through this step by step. So the problem is about finding the smallest constant c such that George's greedy algorithm's price G is always at most c times the optimal price D found by Dave. The key here is to figure out the worst-case scenario where the ratio G/D is maximized.

First, I need to understand both approaches: Dave checks all permutations to find the minimum possible price, which is D. George uses a greedy approach, picking the next number to minimize the current partial sum's absolute value. The question is, how bad can George's result be compared to Dave's?

I remember from the examples that when the numbers are a mix of positives and negatives, Dave can arrange them in a way that balances out the partial sums better. For example, in one scenario with numbers 2,1,-1,-2, Dave arranges them as 1,-2,2,-1, getting partial sums of 1, -1, 1, 0, which gives D=1. But George, following his greedy method, might end up with a sequence like 1,-1,2,-2, resulting in partial sums of 1,0,2,0, so G=2. This example gives a ratio G/D=2, which suggests that c can't be less than 2.

Another example the user considered was numbers 3,2,-2,-1,-1. Here, Dave could arrange them to get D=2, and George also achieved G=2. But that didn't help find a higher ratio.

The critical example that showed c=2 was when George had to pick numbers leading to a partial sum twice as bad as the optimal. This happened when Dave could arrange the numbers to keep partial sums low, but George's choices forced a higher maximum due to the order of selection.

Now, thinking about this generally: George's greedy approach might sometimes make locally optimal choices that don't account for future numbers. This can lead to a situation where the partial sums spike higher than what's possible with a globally optimal arrangement. The example where numbers were 2,1,-1,-2 demonstrated this perfectly, with George's G=2 and Dave's D=1, hence G=2D.

To confirm that c=2 is indeed the upper bound, we need to ensure that no matter the numbers, George's method can't be worse than twice the optimal. If every step George takes might at most double the partial sums (maybe due to alternating signs but not perfectly), then 2 is the factor. This ties into the concept of adversarial examples where the worst-case input forces the greedy algorithm to perform suboptimally.

In summary, by constructing examples where G=2D and showing that no examples with a higher ratio exist, we conclude that the minimal constant c is 2.
