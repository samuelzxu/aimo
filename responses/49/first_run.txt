Okay, let me try to figure out which parts of the reasoning are essential to keep for future steps. The user wants me to mark the necessary tokens with <keep> tags. 

First, the problem statement is crucial. They need to remember that we're dealing with a Hausdorff space where every subspace is σ-compact, and we need to show it's countable. So the first paragraph explaining the problem should be kept.

Next, the contrapositive approach is important. The idea that if X were uncountable, there's a subspace that's not σ-compact. That's a key strategy, so that part should be kept.

The mention that compact sets in Hausdorff spaces are closed is essential because it leads to the conclusion that every subset being Fσ. This connects σ-compactness to being a countable union of closed sets, so those parts should be marked.

The discussion about hereditary Lindelöf properties and how σ-compact implies Lindelöf is important. Since the space is hereditarily Lindelöf, which restricts the possible subspaces, this part needs to be kept.

The Cantor-Bendixson theorem is brought up as a method to decompose the space, which is a crucial step in the argument. Even though it's a bit advanced, it's necessary for understanding the structure of the space, so those sections should be kept.

The critical realization that if every subset is Fσ, then all subsets are Borel, and thus the power set's cardinality is limited, forcing X to be countable is the linchpin of the proof. This part is absolutely vital and must be preserved.

Other parts, like the exploration of various examples (Cantor set, Sorgenfrey line) and some tangential theorems, might be less crucial once the main cardinality argument is established. However, the steps leading to the cardinality conclusion are necessary to retain for the logic to flow correctly.

I need to make sure that each kept block captures complete sentences or phrases without altering the original text. Let me go through the trajectory again and mark the essential parts accordingly.
