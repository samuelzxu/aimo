Okay, so I need to figure out which parts of the reasoning are essential for future steps. Let me go through each paragraph and see where the key points are that need to be kept.

In the first paragraph, the user sets up the problem. They mention Gary drinking m/n of the beverage and the alternative scenario. The essential part here is defining the variables and the equations they set up. Specifically, the original waste as 1 - m/n and the second scenario's waste as 1/2 - 2*(m/n). Those equations are critical for solving the problem, so they should be kept.

Next, they set up the equation 1/2 - 2x = (2/9)(1 - x), where x is m/n. This equation is the core of the solution, so definitely needs to be kept. Solving this equation leads to finding x = 5/32. The steps to solve the equation, like multiplying by 18 and simplifying, are important, but the key result here is x = 5/32. The check confirming that 5 and 32 are coprime is also essential since it validates the final answer.

The alternative interpretation where "twice as much" could be misunderstood is considered. The user evaluates both interpretations and uses the feasibility check (whether the drunk amount exceeds the purchased amount) to discard the incorrect interpretation. This reasoning is crucial because it addresses a potential ambiguity in the problem statement and confirms the correct answer. The calculations showing that one interpretation leads to an impossible scenario while the other doesn't are vital to include.

Finally, the conclusion that m + n = 37 after validating through both algebraic solution and feasibility checks is the ultimate answer. The steps confirming the calculations and the final answer must be retained to ensure correctness.

I should wrap these key equations, critical solving steps, and the validation checks with <keep> tags. This includes the definitions of the waste amounts, the main equation setup, the solving process leading to x = 5/32, the coprimality check, the alternative interpretation's invalidation, and the final answer.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 3: <keep>Gary bought 1 unit of beverage and drank m/n of it. That means he wasted 1 - m/n.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 1: <keep>in the alternate scenario, he purchased half as much, so that would be 1/2 unit instead of 1. And he drank twice as much.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 4: <keep>the equation should be: 1/2 - 2*(m/n) = (2/9)*(1 - m/n)</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 1: <keep>1/2 - 2x = (2/9)(1 - x)</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 3: <keep>Multiply both sides by 18 to eliminate denominators.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 5: <keep>9 - 36x = 4 - 4x</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 7: <keep>5 = 32x</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 8: <keep>x = 5/32</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 2: <keep>m/n = 5/32. Check if 5 and 32 are coprime. Yeah, since 5 is prime and doesn't divide 32, which is a power of 2.</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 6: <keep>1/2 - 2*(5/32)=10/32=5/16</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 7: <keep>wasted amount: 1/2 - 5/16 = 8/16 - 5/16 = 3/16</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 8: <keep>Check if 3/16 is equal to (2/9)*(27/32).</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 9: <keep>2/9 *27/32= (2*27)/(9*32) = (54)/(288) = simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 6: 9/48= 3/16.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 3: <keep>5/14â‰ˆ0.357, which would make 2*(m/n)=0.714, which would exceed 0.5 (the purchased amount in the second scenario).</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 4: <keep>he couldn't possibly drink 0.714 if he only bought 0.5, resulting in negative waste, which contradicts.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 5: <keep>the answer must be 37.</keep>
