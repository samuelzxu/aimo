Okay, so I need to figure out which parts of the existing reasoning are essential for future steps. Let's break it down.

First, the problem is about determining the limit of (log α_n)/n as n approaches infinity, where α_n is the minimal positive value of the integral of x^n f(x) over polynomials f with integer coefficients. The key steps in the reasoning are:

1. Analyzing specific small n cases (n=0, n=1, n=2) to find α_n.
2. Generalizing the integral to sum over coefficients with certain parity.
3. Connecting the problem to Diophantine approximation and lattice theory.
4. Relating the minimal integral value to the least common multiple (LCM) of denominators.
5. Using prime number theorem to estimate LCM growth.
6. Concluding that LCM grows exponentially, leading to the limit -1.

The critical parts here are the transition from specific examples to the general case involving Diophantine approximation, the role of LCM, and the application of the prime number theorem. These sections contain the core reasoning steps that justify the final answer. The detailed calculations for small n are less crucial once the general pattern is established. However, mentioning the LCM connection and the asymptotic behavior of LCM is vital for the conclusion.

Important tokens to preserve include the explanation of how the integral becomes a linear combination, the role of parity in surviving terms, the LCM argument, and the asymptotic analysis using the prime number theorem. These elements are essential for understanding why the limit is -1.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 3: <keep>α_n is the smallest positive real number that such an integral can give. So, essentially, we need to find the minimal positive value of that integral over all possible n-th degree polynomials f with integer coefficients, and then analyze the logarithm of that minimal value divided by n as n becomes large.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 3: <keep>∫_{-1}^1 x^1*(ax + b) dx = ∫_{-1}^1 (a x^2 + b x) dx. The integral of b x from -1 to 1 is zero because it's an odd function.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 3: <keep>the integral expression (2a/5 + 2c/3). Let's factor out 2: 2*(a/5 + c/3). So we need to find integers a and c such that a/5 + c/3 is positive and minimal.</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 4: <keep>the integral is a linear combination of the coefficients a_k (with parity matching the parity of n) scaled by 2/(n + k + 1).</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 1: <keep>the problem reduces to finding the minimal positive value of such a linear combination where the coefficients a_k are integers.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 2: <keep>For large n, x^n is highly peaked near x=1 and x=-1.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 1: <keep>the minimal non-zero value of such a combination is related to the determinant of the lattice formed by these terms.</keep>

- Paragraph 11, Sentence 1: <keep>the minimal absolute value of a linear form with integer coefficients, which in number theory is related to the theory of Diophantine approximation.</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentence 1: <keep>the LCM of numbers from n+1 to 2n +1. So the minimal positive value is 1/LCM(denominators).</keep>

- Paragraph 14, Sentence 1: <keep>LCM(n +1,...,2n +1} ≈ e^{n}, so log LCM≈n.</keep>
