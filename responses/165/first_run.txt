Okay, let's go through the problem step by step. The user wants to form a three-digit and a two-digit number using the digits 2, 4, 6, 7, and 9 exactly once, such that their product is maximized. The goal is to find the three-digit number in that pair.

First, the highest digits available are 9, 7, and 6. Intuitively, placing the largest digits in the highest places (hundreds for three-digit, tens for two-digit) seems logical. But this might not always yield the highest product. Let's test some combinations.

Initially, I considered making the three-digit number 976 and two-digit number 42. The product here is 976 * 42 = 40,992. But this isn't optimal because the two-digit number is too small.

Next, swapping priorities: making a larger two-digit number like 97 and a three-digit number 642. The product here is 642 * 97 = 62,274. Better, but still not the highest.

Then, trying a different combination where the two-digit number is 94 and the three-digit number is 762. Calculating 762 * 94: breaking it down, 700*94 = 65,800; 60*94 = 5,640; 2*94 = 188. Summing these gives 65,800 + 5,640 + 188 = 71,628. This seems higher than previous attempts.

I compared this with other plausible pairs:
- 962 * 74 = 71,188
- 942 * 76 = 71,592
- 742 * 96 = 71,232

Among these, 762 * 94 = 71,628 is the highest. Key factors are balancing the three-digit and two-digit numbers, ensuring both are as high as possible without wasting large digits. Placing 9 in the two-digit number and distributing remaining digits efficiently led to the optimal product.

Thus, the three-digit number that results in the greatest product is 762.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 3: <keep>First, maybe I should recall that when you want two numbers multiplied together to be as large as possible, you want both numbers to be as large as possible. But since we have a fixed set of digits to use (five digits in total, three for one number, two for the other), it's a balance between making the three-digit number large and the two-digit number also large.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 1: <keep>The digits available are 2, 4, 6, 7, 9. To make the largest possible numbers, the highest digits should go to the leftmost positions. Since 9 is the highest, followed by 7, 6, 4, 2.</keep>
