Okay, let's try to figure this out. I need to use the digits 2, 4, 6, 7, and 9 each exactly once to form a three-digit integer and a two-digit integer. Then I multiply them together, and I want to find the three-digit integer that's part of the pair which gives the largest possible product. Hmm.

First, maybe I should recall that when you want two numbers multiplied together to be as large as possible, you want both numbers to be as large as possible. But since we have a fixed set of digits to use (five digits in total, three for one number, two for the other), it's a balance between making the three-digit number large and the two-digit number also large. Just making one of them as large as possible might not work if the other gets too small. So there's probably a strategy here like putting the largest digits in the highest place values. But which combination? Let's start breaking it down.

The digits available are 2, 4, 6, 7, 9. To make the largest possible numbers, the highest digits should go to the leftmost positions. Since 9 is the highest, followed by 7, 6, 4, 2.

But we have to split them into a three-digit and a two-digit number. Let me think: if we give the three-digit number the three highest digits, which would be 9, 7, 6, then the two-digit number would have 4 and 2. Alternatively, if we give the two-digit number 9 and 7, then the three-digit number can get 6, 4, 2. Which product would be bigger?

Wait, let's calculate the actual products.

First scenario: Three-digit number is 976, two-digit is 42. Then the product is 976 x 42. Let me compute that:

976 x 40 = 39,040
976 x 2 = 1,952
Total: 39,040 + 1,952 = 40,992.

Second scenario: Two-digit number is 97, three-digit number is 642. Product is 642 x 97. Let's find this:

642 x 100 = 64,200
Minus 642 x 3 = 1,926
So 64,200 - 1,926 = 62,274.

Wait, 62,274 is significantly larger than 40,992. So in this case, making the two-digit number as large as possible (97) and the three-digit number as 642 (the next largest digits) gives a way better product.

But maybe there are combinations in between where I don't allocate the top two digits to the two-digit number but instead spread them out? Let me see.

For example, maybe three-digit number could be 962 and two-digit number as 74. Let me calculate that. 962 x 74.

Compute 962 x 70 = 67,340

962 x 4 = 3,848

Total: 67,340 + 3,848 = 71,188. That's higher than 62,274. But hold on, 962 uses digits 9,6,2 and 74 uses digits 7,4. But that case, all digits are used once. Wait, the question says to use each digit exactly once, so that is allowed. So why is this possible?

Wait a second, perhaps my initial thought wasn't correct.

Alternative approach. Let's think step by step.

Let me list all possible combinations (or at least the most promising ones) and compute their products.

To do this right, first, recognize that the three-digit number and two-digit number should be as large as possible. However, due to the way multiplication distributes over addition, sometimes a slightly smaller number but balanced with a larger other number can give a bigger product. For example, if making the two-digit number larger and the three-digit a bit smaller might still result in a higher total product.

But in order not to miss the combinations, I need a structured approach.

First, choose which two digits go to the two-digit number. Then arrange the remaining three digits into the three-digit number. To max out their product, the two numbers should be as large as possible, but there's a trade-off.

The key is that the two-digit number has a high weight because it's multiplied by the three-digit number. So, increasing the two-digit number by 1 would effectively be adding the three-digit number to the product. So, maybe even if we take away a small amount from the three-digit number to make the two-digit number bigger, the overall product is higher.

Thus, strategy should likely be to maximize the two-digit number as much as possible, and then use the remaining digits to form the largest possible three-digit number. But as previous example, when I made the two-digit number as 97 vs 96 vs 76..., will this lead to higher product?

Wait when I first tried, the two-digit number using the two largest digits (97) gives two-digit number being 97, and remaining digits 6,4,2; three-digit number 642. That product was 62,274.

Another combination: three-digit number using 9,7,6 as 976, two-digit number as 42, product 40,992, which is significantly lower. So the previous example suggested that a bigger two-digit number even with a smaller three-digit number yields a better product.

But then when I made the two-digit number as 74, and three-digit as 962, leading to 962x74=71,188, which is much bigger. Wait. HOLD ON: This is confusing. The two-digit number 74 is not the maximum possible two-digit number. Because 97 is higher (but with similar reasoning, 962x74 gave 71k but 97x642 gave 62k... which is lower. So why is 74x962 higher? Wait is 962 x 74 actually =71,188?

Yes, looking back:

962 x 70=67,340

962 x 4=3,848

Total is 67,340+3,848=71,188.

Yes, that's right. So even though the two-digit number in this case is 74 (which is less than 97), the three-digit number is 962 (which is higher than 642) leading to a higher product. So maybe the allocation is a balance between the two numbers.

Therefore, perhaps the optimal allocation isn't just putting the two highest into two-digit or into three-digit, but considering the combination...

Therefore, the strategy should be to find the combination where the product is maximum. To achieve this, the two numbers should be as close as possible, perhaps. No, actually, when considering two numbers multiplied, given their sum is not fixed. Wait, while for a fixed sum, the maximum product is when numbers are as close as possible, however, here, sum isn't fixed, but the sum of the digits is fixed. So need another approach.

Alternative approach:

Given two numbers, a three-digit number and a two-digit number, formed using distinct digits from 2,4,6,7,9. To maximize the product, we need to maximize both numbers, but allocating digits to the higher place values. Since a three-digit number has hundreds, tens, ones and two-digit number has tens and ones. Allocating the largest digits to the hundreds place (of three-digit) and the tens place (of two-digit) might yield better results.

Alternatively, it's more optimal whether the largest digit goes to the hundreds place of the three-digit number or the tens place of the two-digit number.

Suppose we try choosing which of the large digits are allocated where.

The available digits: 2, 4, 6, 7, 9

We have three-digit number (XYZ) and two-digit number (AB). So digits in XYZ and AB are all distinct.

If we allocate digit 9 (the largest) to hundreds place of three-digit number (X), then digit 7 can go to the tens place of either three-digit or two-digit number.

Similarly, the next digits.

Wait let's structure all possible two-digit numbers:

Possible two-digit numbers from the digits given. The two-digit number can be formed of any two unique digits. To check their possible values. Let's list all possible two-digit numbers from 2,4,6,7,9:

24, 26, 27, 29, 42, 46, 47, 49, 62, 64, 67, 69, 72, 74, 76, 79, 92, 94, 96, 97.

So many two-digit numbers. Now, the largest two-digit numbers from 97,96,94,92,79,76,74,72,69,67, etc. The top five being 97,96,94,92,79. Let's check the pairs.

First, if we take two-digit number as 97, then three-digit number must be 6,4,2. So maximum possible three-digit number is 642. Then 642 * 97 is 62,274.

Next, two-digit number as 96. Then remaining digits are 7,4,2. So three-digit number as 742. 742*96.

Let me compute 742 x96. 742*100=74,200. Minus 742*4=2,968. So 74,200 - 2,968 = 71,232. So product is 71,232.

Compare with previous 71,188 (when two-digit was 74 and three-digit was 962). Wait, 71,232 is higher.

Third, two-digit number as 94. Then remaining digits are 7,6,2. Three-digit number would be 762. 762 x 94.

Calculate: 762*90 = 68,580

762*4 = 3,048

Total: 68,580 +3,048 =71,628.

Which is higher again. Wait, that's even higher.

Fourth, two-digit as 92. Remaining digits: 7,6,4. Three-digit would be 764. 764 x 92.

764*90=68,760

764*2=1,528

Total: 68,760+1,528=70,288.

Next, two-digit as 79. Then remaining digits:6,4,2. Max three-digit: 642. 642x79.

642*70=44,940

642*9=5,778

Total: 44,940 +5,778=50,718.

So far, the products when using highest two-digit numbers:

- 97: 62,274

-96:71,232

-94:71,628

-92:70,288

-79:50,718

So among these, when two-digit as 94 and rest digits forming 762, product is71,628.

But prior found in an example trying two-digit 74 and three-digit 962, product was71,188.

But hold on, isn't there even higher products? Let's look.

What if two-digit number is 76. Remaining digits are9,4,2. Three-digit number will be942. 942x76.

Compute 942x70=65,940

942x6=5,652

Total: 65,940 +5,652=71,592.

Compare to 71,628 for two-digit 94 and three-digit 762. 71,592 vs71,628: So 762x94=71,628 vs942x76=71,592â†’762x94 is slightly higher.

Next, two-digit as74. Remaining digits9,6,2.Three-difit number is962. 962x74=71,188.

Two-digit as 69. Hmm, 69 is lower, so might not be worth.

Wait, perhaps going through all combinations isn't feasible here, but maybe we can methodically consider.

Alternatively, maybe there's a higher product.

Another thought: Maybe if we spread the higher digits across both numbers, so both are large.

For example, three-digit number uses 9 and 6, and the two-digit number uses 7 and 4. Then remaining digit is 2. Wait, let's think. If three-digit is 962 and two-digit is74, that uses digits9,6,2,7,4.

Yes, and the product was962x74=71,188.

Alternatively, three-digit uses9 and7, two-digit uses6 and4, leaving digit2. So 974x62. Let's calculate.

974*60=58,440

974*2=1,948

Total=58,440+1,948=60,388. Which is lower.

Alternatively, three-digit numbered 764, with two-digit as92:70,288 as above.

Alternatively, three-digit 742 with two-digit96:71,232.

Alternatively, two-digit as76 and three-digit as942: about71,592, and another is two-digit as49?, leading to lower.

But 762x94=71,628 is higher.

Next candidate: if two-digit number is67.The remaining digits would be9,4,2. Three-digit number is942. Then 942 x67= let's calculate.

942x60=56,520

942x7=6,594

Total:56,520+6,594=63,114. Which is lower.

Alternatively, two-digit number as46, three-digit number as972.972x46.

Calculate: 900x46=41,400

72x46=3,312

Total:41,400+3,312=44,712. Nope, that's worse.

Perhaps two-digit as 42? No, that's the previous where we have 42x976=40,992.

So maybe the top contenders so far are:

762x94=71,628

942x76=71,592

764x92=70,288

962x74=71,188

742x96=71,232

So the maximum we've found yet is 762*94=71,628.

Wait, but wait why didnâ€™t this one with 762 and 94 come earlier?

Alright, here we split the usage: digits for three-digit are7,6,2 (but 2 isn't the largest, unless the digits for three-digit are7,6,2. Wait, let's confirm:

If two-digit number is94, then remaining digits are7,6,2. So three-digit is762. Yes.

Therefore, product is762*94=71,628.

But 76 in two-digit with three-digit of 942 is942*76=71,592. Which is slightly lower.

Wait, maybe another splitting? Maybe allocate 9 to the two-digit number but combined with something else.

For example, two-digit as96. Then three-digit number is742. Product742*96=71,232.

Alternatively, two-digit as69??? It's lower but let's check. two-digit69, three-digit742? No, two-digit69 uses6 and9, so remaining digits7,4,2. Three-digit number742. 742*69=51,198, which is lower.

Well, perhaps the highest product is762x94=71,628. Let me confirm:

Calculating 762*94:

First, 700*94=65,800

60*94=5,640

2*94=188

Total:65,800 +5,640=71,440 +188=71,628.

Yes.

But before declaring that's the winner, let me check other possible high combinations. For example:

Suppose two-digit as86â€”but wait, thereâ€™s 8 in the digits provided? No, available digits are2,4,6,7,9. So wait no, all possible numbers must consist from these digits, no repeats. So only 2,4,6,7,9. So no eight.

Another one: two-digit as64, then three-digit number would be972. Wait, digits for two-digit64 would make three-digit numbers972. Wait, 9,7,2. Yes. Then 972 x64.

Calculate:

900*64=57,600.

72*64=4,608.

Total:57,600 +4,608=62,208. Which is lower than some.

Alternatively, two-digit as46, three-digit as972. 972x46.

Which as we calculated was 44,712.

Not great. Wait, let's see, what about two-digit as73? But there is no 3 available. Only 2,4,6,7,9. So two-digit numbers must be made from these.

Wait perhaps 72, which is another combination. Let's check three-digit number - if two-digit is72, remaining digits are 9,6,4. So three-digit is964. Then 964*72.

Calculate:

900*72=64,800

64*72=4,608

Total:64,800 +4,608=69,408. Which is lower than 71k.

Is there a two-digit number using the next digits?

Alternatively, two-digit as62. Then three-digit number would be974. Then 974*62.

Calculate:

900*62=55,800

74*62=4,588

Total:55,800+4,588=60,388. Again, lower.

How about two-digit number as29. Three-digit number would then be764. 764*29=764*30 -764=22,920-764=22,156. Much lower.

What about two-digit as47. Three-digit number would be962. So 962*47. Let me compute:

900*47=42,300

62*47=2,914

Total: 42,300+2,914=45,214. Lower.

What about two-digit as59? There's no5 available. Ah, correct.

Back to the list. Let's look for two-digit numbers as 76, 74, 96, 94, etc., all covered.

So the combination that gives the highest product so far is three-digit762 * two-digit94=71,628.

But wait a minute: just occurred to me, if two-digit number is 74 and three-digit number is962. Are digits reused?74 uses digits7 and4, and962 uses9,6,2. Correct, no repeats. So product is962*74=71,188. Which is a bit lower than 762x94=71,628.

Is there another combination where the three-digit number is even higher?

What about two-digit number 42, three-digit number976. Then product is976*42=40,992.

Not better. How about two-digit number24, but no, too low.

Alternatively, two-digit number 46, gave942x76.

Wait, no, if two-digit is46, three-digit becomes972. As above.

Wait, perhaps considering different allocations where another group's selected.

Wait, two-digit number as 79. Remaining digits would be6,4,2, three-digit number is642. 642*79=50,718. As calculated earlier, which is low.

Alternatively, let's try two-digit number as 67. Then remaining digits:9,4,2. Three-digit number is942. 942*67. Calculated before, 63,114. Lower.

So stepping back, the maximum computed is762x94=71,628.

But let me confirm once again with different combinations in case I missed one.

Alternatively, three-digit is764 and two-digit is92. 764*92=70,288. Lower.

Another scenario, three-digit is769, but cannot, no.

Since available digits after choosing two must use three but no repeats.

Wait could there be a three-digit number with 9,6,X and two-digit with7,y, but if X=4, then y=2.

For example, three-digit694 and two-digit72.

694*72.

Calculate:

700*72=50,400 then minus6*72=432, so 50,400-432=49,968. Hmm, no, higher if we do like 694*72:

Compute:

600*72= 43,200

90*72=6,480

4*72= 288

Total: 43,200 +6,480=49,680 +288=49,968. Which is significantly lower.

Alternatively, three-digit number729 with two-digit64. 729*64.

Calculate:

700*64=44,800

29*64=1,856

Total:44,800 +1,856=46,656.

Still low.

Alternatively, Three-digit number749and two-digit62. 749*62. Compute:

700*62=43,400

49*62=3,038

Total:43,400+3,038=46,438.

Less than before.

Another combination, three-digit492and two-digit76.492*76.

Calculate:

400*76=30,400

92*76=6,992

Total=30,400+6,992=37,392. Even lower.

Perhaps all right, maybe72,628 is indeed the highest.

Wait, but let's give a different thought: perhaps the product of a three-digit number ABC and two-digit number DE as (100A +10B + C)*(10D + E). Expanding gives:

100A*10D + 100A*E + 10B*10D +10B*E + C*10D + C*E.

So=1000AD + 100AE + 100BD +10BE + 10CD + CE.

Thus, the terms are sorted by their magnitude, and from the highest, 1000AD, so maximizing A*D is important. Then next term is100AE +100BD, so then A*E and B*D. Thus coefficients are 100. Then next terms scaled by 10 and so on.

Thus, to maximize the product, the most important thing is A*D, then AE and BD, then BE, CD, then the rest.

Therefore, if possible, maximizing A and D.

Ourdigits are2,4,6,7,9.

Assuming three-digit isABC, two-digit is DE.

So variables: A, B, C, D, E : all in {2,4,6,7,9}, all unique.

Goal: Maximizing ABC * DE = (100A + 10B + C)*(10D + E)

Breaking it down, as per expansion, coefficients:

Term1:1000AD

Term2:100AE +100 BD

Term3:10BE +10CD

Term4:CE (plus rest)

So to maximize this, need to concentrate on higher terms first.

So Term1: 1000AD is the most significant. Thus, our biggest gain would be from the highest achievable product of A and D.

Available digits for A and D should to be as large as possible.

Original digits (9,7,6,4,2)

If we can makeA=9 and D=7, that givesAD=63.

Alternatively,A=7 andD=9, which might be similar but same product.

Alternatively, if possible, if allocating digits:

Setting A=9 and D=7. Resulting in AD=9*7=63.

Alternatively, if two-digit number needs two digits, which are E as well. So if three-digit number is9BC, let two-digit number be7E. Then digits left are 6,4,2 for B, C, E. But E can only be one digit. Wait, but D=7 already uses digit7, E must be another digit. So after A=9 and D=7, digits left:6,4,2. To assign B and C for the three-digit number (B, C digits being6,4,2) and E for the two-digit number (but E is same?)Wait no, D=7 and E is another digit. So two-digit number DE is D=7 and E which is one from6,4,2, and three-digit is9, X, Y, where X and Y are other two.

But need to clarify:

Wait, in the scenario where A=9(first digit of three-digit) and D=7(first digit of two-digit), then the remaining digits are6,4,2. So assign them to B,C,E. How?

So three-digit number would be9 6 4 (if B and C take the next highest digits6 and4), and two-digit number would take E=2. So DE=72. Then the product is964 *72= previously calculated as 69,408.

Alternatively, If we assign three-digit number9 6 2 and DE=74.Then product is962*74=71,188.Which is higher.

If we arrange three-digit number9 4 2 with DE=76 (taking76 as two-digit). Then product would be942*76=71,592. So 71,592. So this one is better. This assignment uses A=9, D=7; three-digit: 9,6,2. Then two-digit:7,4. Wait, let me check digits. Wait, D is7, E is6? Wait no.

Wait, in the scenario where A=9,D=7. Then remaining digits are6,4,2. So three-digit has to have two more digits. Wait, three-digit number is9,B,C. So B and C need to be from6,4,2. So then DE would be7,E, where E is remaining digits. For example, if three-digit is96 and 4: 964. So B=6, C=4, then E=2. DE=72. So 964*72=69,408.

Alternatively, to make DE=76, we need D=7 and E=6, but then the remaining digits for three-digit are9,4,2. Then ABC=942. Then product is942*76=71,592. Ah, so E can be 6 only if we allocate D=7 and E=6, but then ABC=9,4,2. Wait no, A is9. So if we take D=7 and e=6, then B and C can be4 and2. Thus three-digit:9,4,2. So leading to942*76=71,592.

So in this case, to getthe DE=76, that would take digits 7 and6 for the two-digit number, so three-digit number is942.

Wait, but Wait: if DE is76, so digitsused are7 and6. Then remaining digits are9,4,2 for three-digit, so942. Wait: the three-digit number would be942.

But is that digits used correctly? Yes:9,4,2 vs7 and6. All digits used correctly.

Then the product is942x76=71,592. So not bad, but less than when the two-digit numbers were94and three-digitnumbers were762.

So let's check if possible D is9. Wait, since D is the first digit of a two-digit number. Perhaps if D=9 to get higher term, but if two-digit number is9X, but then A, first digit of three-digit number, would be a lower digit.Let's say two-digit as95 but there's no5. Wait, digits are2,4,6,7,9. So possibleDE=9, then? Yes, as in two-digit numbers92,94,96,97.

Case: D=9. Then two-digit number uses9 and some other digit. Supposee=7. Then two-digit number is97. Remaining digits:6,4,2. For three-digit number:642. Then product is642x97=62,274.

Alternatively, two-digit as96, then remaining digits7,4,2. three-digit number 742. Then product is742x96=71,232.

Similarly, two-digit as94: remains7,6,2 forming three-digit number762. 762x94=71,628.

So, when we set D=9( two-digit number as94),then three-digit number use7,6,2â†’product762x94=71,628, which is higher than other combinations where D=9.

Alternatively,what if we chose another A?

Other option: Having A=7 (first digit of three-digit number), then D as9 (first digit of two-digit number):

three-digit number starts with7, two-digit numbers stats with9. Then remaining digits and so on.

For example:

Example1:

Three-digit number7,6,X. Then two-digit number9,y.

Remaining digits: from 2,4. Take XandY: digits used. If Two-digit number9,4, leaving6,2. So three-digit number. 762. Actually. Wait, this would be same as above.

Alternatively:

Three-digit number7,6,4. Two-digit number92. Product764= but computed previously, as764*92=70,288.

Alternatively, Three-digit number7,2,X. Since need to make the three-digit number high. For instance,7,6,2 (no). Wait, similar to prior example.

Perhaps, when A=7, three-digit number has7, followed by9 and6. But since two-digit number is using9 if D=9. But D=9 would already take nine for the two-digit.

So, perhaps it doesn't make sense.

Thus when A=7 and D=9, three-digit number uses7, remaining digits (from6,4,2), same as earlier.

Alternatively, if D=6, which is lesser, but maybe three-digit number starts with9 and7. For example, creating a three-digit number such as974 in which case two-digit number would be62. Wait, how would that split the digits.

Wait three-digit number974 uses9,7,4. two-digit number would use digits6,2. SoDE=62. Then product is974x62=60,388. Not so high.

Alternatively,three-digit number972with two-digit64. Product62, 208. Not high.

Alternatively, take three-digit number964 and two-digit72. Product69,480. As before.

Alternative case: Set A=6. Hmmm, three-digit number starting with6 doesn't seem optimal, since we have higher digits available.

Thus, in an attempt to maximize the key term4D( A*D); the maximum product A*D obtainable is when A=9 and D=7 resultingin9*7=63. Similarly7*9=63 (since swapping D with A yields same). Once set, next important terms are combinations of A*E andB* D.

Suppose A is9, D is7.Then Terms being100A*E and100BD.

To maximise terms here:

Given remaining digits are6,4,2. Let's assign E.

Assuming digits left for E, B, C are6,4,2, use the E in such. If we set E to6, then for the term100A*E=100*9*6=5400; also term100B*D=100* (B and D) But D=7. Which digit is B?

If we set E=6, then remaining digits B and C would be4 and2. So three-digit number would be9,4,2â†’942. Then if we have B=4, then term100*B*D=100*4*7=2800. If we choose E=high to increase first term.

Alternatively, if we set E=4, then remaining digits B and C are6 and2. Three-digit number is962. Then term100A*E=100*9*4=3600, term100B*D=100*6*7=4200.

These two terms combined=3600+4200=7800 vs previous 5400+2800=8200.

Wait, 3600+4200=7800 vs5400+2800=8200. So in this case. Assigning higher E might lead to higher overall since term1 1000AD is fixed. Let's compute.

If E=6: terms sum then are:

1000AD=63,000

100AE=9*6*100=5,400

100BD=4*7*100=2,800

Rest for BE and CD:

+10*(B=4* E=6) +10*(C=2*D=7) +C=2* E=6 =10*24 +10*14 +12=240 +140 +12=392

So total product=63,000 +5,400 +2,800 +392= 71,592.

In the other case, when E=4;

terms:

1000AD=63,000

100AE=9*4*100=3,600

100BD=6*7*100=4,200

BE=6*4=24; CD=2*7=14. So 10*24 + 10*14=240 +140=380 plus CE=2*4=8

Total=380 +8=388

Total product=63,000+3,600+4,200+388=71,188.

So in this way, when E=6, product=71,592, vs E=4=71,188.

Hence, in that scenario with A=9, D=7, choosing E=6 leads to a higher product.

However, we also need to check the C digits. When E=6:

two-digit numberDE=7-6 is76. Three-digit number is942.

Product=942 x76=71,592.

Where else, when E=4:

DE=74 with three-digit number962, product=962x74=71,188. Thus previous conclusion is confirmed.

The first case is higher.

Alternatively, set E=2:

DE=then 72. Three-digit number=964 but assigned the digits as9,B,C,B andC as to digits6 and4. So three-digit number964. Product=964x72=69,408.

Which is lower than 71,592.

Hence, when A=9,D=7 with E=6. Product=71,592. But we also have a scenario where we set A=7,D=9.

Wait,previously mentioned, as two-digit number94 and three-digit number762, product72x( if)

Wait D=9, if two-digit number is94, aproduct of762x94=71,628. This is slightly higher than the942x76=71,592.

Because when you set D=9, the first term would be1000AD=1000*7*9=63,000, same as when D=7 and A=9. Then the difference comes from other terms.

But this would happen only if we swap where the largest digits are allocated between A and D.

If we take A=7 and D=9, two-digit number as94 (digits9 and4), let's verify.

Three-digit number using digits7,6,2. So700 +60 +2=762. Then DE=94. Thus product 762x94.

=762*90 +762*4 =68,580 +3,048=71,628.

Meanwhile, if this allocation is used,A*D=7*9=63.

The 1000AD=63,000.

But the rest of the terms:

100AE= 7*4*100=2,800

100BD=6*9*100=5,400

10BE=10*6*4=240

10CD=10*2*9=180

CE=4*2=8

Total additions:2,800 +5,400=8,200 +240 +180=8,620 +8=8,628

which on top of 63,000 gives71,628.

Comparing that to the previous case when A=9, D=7, DE=76,ABC=942: product71,592, which is ever so slightly less.

OK, so it's vital to notice that swapping A and D (from 9,7; versus7,9) gives a better overall product given that the subsequentterm sums are betterã€‚

Because when A=9 and D=7:

Term2: 100AE + 100BD. Here AE=9*E, and BD=B*7. For former case when E=6 and B=4, this term would be100*(9*6) +100*(4*7)=5,400 +2,800=8,200.

Where in swap case A=7 and D=9, using E=4, DE=A=7, so two-digit number is94.Then term100*AE=100*7*4=2,800, term 100*BD=100*6*9=5,400. Total=8,200.

Same, but what changes are the next terms:

Term3:10(BE + CD)=10*(6*4 +2*9)=10*(24 +18)=10*42=420.

Term4: CE=2*4=8.

Total addition from term3 and4=420+8=428.

So total product in swap case:63,000 (term1)+8,200(term2)+428(terms3&4)=71,628.

In previous allocation:

Term with A=9, D=7, sum of 63,000 +5,400 +2,800 +240 +140 +12=71,592. As detailed before.

Wait, actually, the difference boils down to higher term3 in swap case, because assigning CE as2*9( CD).

Wait a second, not all terms sum the same. So how?

When A=7, DE=94, three-digit as762:

product=762*94=71,628.

When A=9, DE=76, three-digit as942:

product=942*76=71,592.

Difference:71,628-71,592=36.

Hence, the allocation where A=7, D=9 gives a higher product by 36.

So here, the takeaway: even term1 (1000AD) is the same (both A=9,D=7 andA=7,D=9 give same AD), but depending on allocation of remaining digits, the total product has a little advantage when we swap A and D.

Wait, so key insight is that when distributing the Two highest digits (9 and7) between A and D, then arranging remaining digits may give different results. So in how we distribute the remaining digits. In swap case:

When A=7 and. D=9, and DE=94(E=4), ABC=762. So digits A=7, D=9,E=4. Remaining digits6,2â†’given to ABC at B and C. Hence,so then term3 computes as10*(B*E + C*D)=10*(6*4 +2*9)=10*(24 +18)=420 vs a situation in where:

When A=9, D=7, two-digit number=76(E=6). Three-digit number=942.

So remaining digits4 and2. SoBC being4,2, so term3:

10*(4*7 +2*E)=wait, no, terms are:

BE is B=4*E=6?

Wait no.

Wait BC in 9_ _:

In three-digitnumber942: B=4,C=2. In two-digitnumber=76(E=6).

Hence,BE+CD is B*E +C*D=4*6 +2*7=24 +14=38, so term3 is10*38=380.

term4:CE=2*6=12.

Total:380+12=392.

In swap case,ABC=762:B=6,C=2, DE=94:D=9,E=4.

 term3:10*(B*E + C*D)=10*(6*4 +2*9)=10*(24+18)=10*42=420.

term4:CE=2*4=8. Total term3 and4:420 +8=428.

428 vs 392. So in swap case,terms3and4 give 36 more. Which then results in total product higher by36:71,628â€“71,592=36). Hence, key.

Thus,in summary:

To maximize, assign the two highest digits to either A and D, then distribute remaining digits such that the terms of term3 and term4 are also maximized.

So in this case, when swapped toDE=94 and ABC=762, got a slight better product.

Furthermore, when D=9, swapping to, but in previous, when A=9 and D=7 with different assignments, product was slightly less.

Thus, seems like762 and94 gives thebest.

Similarly, let's check if there is anyway that we can get a higher product with different assignments. By using a combination where, perhaps, the D is not one of the two top digits.

For example, if we set A=6, D=9. Then three-digit number starting with6. Wait, such allocations would likely be worse.

Another scenario:three-digit number begins with6 and digit9 in two-digit: for examplDE=97. Then three-digit number having6 and remaining digits4 and2:642,so prod642*97=62,274. Which is lower.

Alternatively, three-digit starting with6, two-digit96. Remaining digits7,4,2. But D=9, E=6. But A=6, so three-digit number642two-digit number97 product62,274 as earlier. Not beneficial.

Another way: using A=7, D=6 for two-digit number. Wait if D=6, two-digit number as64. Let's see.

Three-digit number usingdigits9,7,4, two-digit64: but this leaves digit2. So three-digit number would be974. Two-digit number62. Then product=974x62=60,388. Lower.

Alternatively, three-digit number972x64=62,208. Lower.

So, hard to see any other combination that could give higher. So perhaps72,628 is the maximum possible.

Alternatively,three-digit number 764 and two-digit number92. Then prod764x92=70,288. Lower.

No, likely 762x94=71,628 is maximum.

Is there a possibility of combinations swapping other digits not yet considered? For example:
Using two-digit74 and three-digitNumber 962=962x74=71,188. Which is known, less-than-superior.

Alternatively, two-digit number47 and three-digit number 962=47~962, way lower.

Alternatively, checktwo-digit as69and three-digitNumber742=which is still  742x69 As per previous calculation was 51,198. Lower.

So, yeah. Then it's evident that 762x94=71,628 provides the largest product. Therefore, I think the three-digit integer needed is762.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{762}
