Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is about predicting the next transit time of TOI 402.01, which is the 23rd transit since the last observed one. We have the last transit time and its uncertainty, as well as the orbital period and its uncertainty. The goal is to calculate the next transit time and its associated uncertainty.

First, the central value for the next transit time. The last transit was at 2139.1 TESS JD, and we need to add 23 orbital periods of 4.756 days each. 

Calculating 23 times 4.756:
23 * 4.756 = 109.388 days.

Adding this to the last transit time:
2139.1 + 109.388 = 2248.488 TESS JD.

Now, for the uncertainty. The uncertainty in the last transit time (σ_T0) is ±0.0027008 days. The uncertainty in each period (σ_P) is ±0.000023 days. Over 23 periods, this accumulates to 23 * 0.000023 = 0.000529 days. 

Since these uncertainties are independent, we combine them in quadrature:
σ_total = √(σ_T0² + (n * σ_P)²)
σ_total = √(0.0027008² + 0.000529²)
σ_total ≈ √(0.000007294 + 0.0000002798)
σ_total ≈ √(0.0000075738) ≈ 0.002752 days.

Looking at the options, none exactly match 0.002752. However, option C (0.0027238) is the closest. The slight discrepancy might be due to rounding or approximation in the problem's given options. Therefore, the best answer, considering the given choices, is option C.
