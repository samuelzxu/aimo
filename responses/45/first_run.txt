Okay, let's tackle part (a) first. The problem gives us a function f: Z → Z with specific values at 1, 2, and -4, and a functional equation involving constants a, b, c. My goal is to find a general formula for f(x).

Starting with the functional equation f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) + axy(x + y) + bxy + c(x + y) + 4. A common strategy is to plug in specific values for x and y to create equations that can solve for the constants. 

First, I'll set x = 0 and y = 0 to find f(0). Plugging these into the equation gives f(0) = 2f(0) + 4, leading to f(0) = -4. This gives another data point.

Next, I can use x = 1 and y = 1 to find an equation involving a, b, c. Plugging into the functional equation: 20 = 1 + 1 + 2a + b + 2c + 4, simplifying to 2a + b + 2c = 14 (Equation 1).

Trying x = 2 and y = 2 gives another equation. The left side is f(4), and the right side includes terms from f(2), f(2), and the constants. Using the recurrence relation derived from the functional equation (by setting y = 1), I can express f(4) in two ways. This leads to another equation: 2a + b + 3c = 14 (Equation 2). Subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2 gives c = 0.

With c = 0, Equation 1 simplifies to 2a + b = 14. To find another equation, I consider setting x = -1 and y = 1. This uses the known f(-4) and f(1) to relate f(-1) and the constants. Through substitution and using the recurrence relation, I verify that these steps reinforce the value of c = 0 and help express f(-1) in terms of b.

Assuming f(x) is a cubic polynomial (since the functional equation includes cubic terms), I let f(x) = kx³ + mx² + nx + p. Expanding both sides of the functional equation and equating coefficients leads to solving for k, m, n, and p. Using the known values f(1), f(2), f(-4), and f(0), I solve the system of equations to find k = 1, m = 4, n = 0, p = -4. Thus, f(x) = x³ + 4x² - 4.

For part (b), the inequality f(x) ≥ mx² + (5m +1)x + 4m must hold for all non-negative integers x. Substituting f(x) into the inequality and simplifying, the most restrictive condition comes from x = 0, which gives -4 ≥ 4m → m ≤ -1. Checking m = -1 satisfies all other x values due to the dominance of the cubic term for large x. Hence, the greatest possible m is -1.
