Okay, let's go through this problem step by step. The question is about how the ratio of silicon atoms in two energy levels changes when a star has plages covering 30% of its surface compared to when it doesn't. The key points here are understanding the effect of temperature on the Boltzmann distribution and how the presence of hotter regions (plages) affects the overall ratio.

First, the star's effective temperature (Teff) changes when plages are present. Without plages, Teff is 6000K. When 30% of the surface is covered by plages, the overall Teff increases by 1000K to 7000K. This increase happens because plages are hotter regions, contributing more to the star's luminosity due to the T^4 dependence in the Stefan-Boltzmann law.

Next, the ratio of silicon atoms in two energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation: n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)). Here, ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, which we calculate using the given wavelength (14404 Å) and converting it to energy using ΔE = hc/λ. The energy difference turns out to be approximately 0.861 eV.

When plages are present, the star's photosphere isn't uniform. 30% of the surface is at a higher temperature (Th), and 70% remains at 6000K. However, the problem simplifies this by considering the overall effective temperature increase to 7000K. Using this, we calculate the factor by which the ratio changes by comparing the Boltzmann factors at 6000K and 7000K.

The critical calculation involves the exponent in the Boltzmann factor: ΔE/(k T). For 6000K, this value is around 1.666, and for 7000K, it's approximately 1.185. The ratio of the exponents gives the factor by which the ratio changes. The result is approximately 1.27, matching answer choice B.

Key steps kept include the Teff change, energy difference calculation, Boltzmann factors at different temperatures, and the final factor calculation. These are essential for understanding how temperature affects the population ratio and arriving at the correct answer.
