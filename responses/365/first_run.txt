Okay, let me try to figure out which parts of this long reasoning are essential to keep for future steps. The problem is about evaluating an infinite series involving cross products and dot products. The user wants me to identify the key tokens that are necessary for the reasoning.

First, the question setup is critical: understanding that vectors are defined recursively via cross product with u, and the series involves even-indexed terms. So the initial definitions (u, v₀, recursion) need to be kept.

Then, the user computes the first few terms to find a pattern. These calculations show how each vector is derived, which might be essential for recognizing the recursive pattern or scaling factors. However, maybe the key insight here is the realization that the transformation matrix T is key, so highlighting the part where they derive T's matrix and eigenvalues.

The key step comes when they analyze the matrix T, compute its eigenvalues, and apply the Cayley-Hamilton theorem to establish the recurrence relation T³ = -1/3 T. This seems crucial because it allows the expression of higher powers of T in terms of lower powers, which is fundamental for summing the series.

Then, they connect the series to a geometric series in T², which is another important leap. The part where they represent the sum W = ∑v_{2n} as T²(I - T²)^{-1} v₀ is pivotal here. Solving for W requires inverting (I - T²), which involves detailed matrix computations. The inverse calculation using the Sherman-Morrison formula is a critical step that needs to be retained because it directly leads to the final result.

Finally, the substitution of values into the inverse matrix and the dot product with (3,2,1) gives the final answer. These computations must be kept to show how each component contributes to the result.

So the essential parts include the definition of T, its eigenvalues, the recurrence relation from Cayley-Hamilton, the geometric series approach, the inverse matrix calculation, and the final dot product. Detailed step-by-step cross product computations might be less critical once the pattern is recognized, but the key derivations of T and its properties are necessary.
