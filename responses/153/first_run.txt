Okay, I need to figure out which parts of the existing reasoning are essential for future steps. Let's go through each paragraph and identify key information that would be necessary if someone were to continue or verify the calculations.

1. **Question and Data Setup**: The problem statement and data are fundamental. Without these, the reasoning has no context. So, the table of x and y values, as well as the formula to determine parameters, must be kept.

2. **Initial Reasoning**: The user recalls the normal equations for least squares. This is crucial because these equations form the basis of all subsequent calculations. Mentioning the normal equations and their form for a quadratic model is key.

3. **Summations Calculation**: Calculating sums like sum_x, sum_x², sum_x³, sum_x⁴, sum_y, sum_xy, and sum_x²y are all critical steps. These sums are plugged into the normal equations to solve for the parameters. Therefore, the computed values of these sums need to be retained.

4. **Simplification of Equations**: Noticing that sum_x and sum_x³ are zero due to symmetry simplifies the equations. This insight reduces the complexity of solving the system, so mentioning this is important.

5. **Solving for a2**: The direct computation of a2 from the second equation is a key step. The values used here (sum_xy and sum_x²) and the result must be kept.

6. **Setting Up Equations 1 and 3**: The simplified equations for a1 and a3 are vital. These equations are solved simultaneously, so their expressions and the substitution steps are necessary for continuity.

7. **Matrix Approach and Cramer's Rule**: Using matrix methods to solve the system provides a precise solution. The determinant calculation and matrix inversion steps are essential for validating the solution.

8. **Final Parameter Values**: The computed values of a1, a2, and a3, along with the verification steps (like plugging back into the original data points), are critical as they represent the conclusion of the problem-solving process.

Throughout the process, maintaining the logical flow from setting up the problem to calculating the sums, simplifying equations, solving the system, and verifying the results is essential. Each mathematical expression and computed value that directly contributes to the final answer must be preserved. Detailed intermediate steps that show the derivation of key equations or values should also be kept to ensure the reasoning is transparent and verifiable.
