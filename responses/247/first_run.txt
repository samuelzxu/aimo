Okay, let's start by understanding the problem. We have an acute triangle ABC with altitudes AD and BE. The circumcenter O lies on the segment DE. We need to find the value of sinA sinB cosC.

First, I recall that the circumcenter of a triangle is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors and is equidistant from all vertices. Since O lies on DE, which connects the feet of two altitudes, this must impose a specific relationship between the triangle's angles or sides.

The key steps involve setting up coordinate systems or using trigonometric identities. However, coordinate geometry might get complicated, so focusing on trigonometric relationships might be more efficient.

Using the Law of Sines, we know that in any triangle, the sides are proportional to the sines of their opposite angles. The product sinA sinB cosC can be expressed in terms of the triangle's sides and circumradius R. By analyzing the condition that O lies on DE and utilizing properties of the circumradius and the orthocenter, it's deduced that the value simplifies to 1/2 through geometric properties and trigonometric identities, indicating a specific ratio inherent in the triangle's configuration when O is on DE.

Therefore, after considering various approaches and verifying through critical steps, the final answer is determined to be 1/2.
