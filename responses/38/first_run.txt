Alright, let's break this problem down step by step. We have three cyclists—Ana, Bob, and Cao—starting from the northeast corner of a rectangular field. The field's longer side runs west, meaning the length (L) is west-east, and the width (W) is north-south. They all reach point D on the south edge at the same time. We need to find the ratio of L:W:x (where x is the distance from D to the southeast corner) and sum p+q+r.

First, let's establish the coordinates. The northeast corner is (0,0). The south edge runs from (0,W) (southeast) to (-L,W) (southwest). Point D is at (-x,W), x meters west of the southeast corner.

**Key Steps:**

1. **Travel Times:**
   - **Ana** bikes west along the north edge to (-L,0), south to (-L,W), then east to (-x,W). Total distance: 2L + W - x.
   - **Bob** bikes south to (0,W) then west to (-x,W). Total distance: W + x.
   - **Cao** bikes straight from (0,0) to (-x,W). Distance: √(x² + W²).

2. **Equation Setup:**
   - Equate travel times for Ana and Bob:
     \[
     \frac{2L + W - x}{8.6} = \frac{W + x}{6.2}
     \]
   - Solve for L in terms of W and x:
     \[
     L = \frac{12}{31}(W + x)
     \]

3. **Cao's Time Equation:**
   - Equate Bob's and Cao's times:
     \[
     \frac{W + x}{6.2} = \frac{\sqrt{x² + W²}}{5}
     \]
   - Substitute 6.2 = 31/5, leading to:
     \[
     25(W + x) = 31\sqrt{x² + W²}
     \]
   - Squaring both sides and simplifying yields a quadratic in terms of r = W/x. Solving gives r = 7/24.

4. **Determine Ratios:**
   - Substituting r = 7/24 (W = 7x/24) into L's equation gives L = 30x/24. Simplifying ratios:
     - L:W:x = 30:7:24
   - Check gcd(30,7)=1, so p=30, q=7, r=24. Summing gives 61.

**Crucial Tokens for Future Steps:**

- Ana's path and time equation relate L, W, and x.
- Solving the quadratic for r establishes the ratio between W and x.
- Substituting back to find L completes the ratio L:W:x.
- The final ratio's co-prime check ensures correct simplification.
