Alright, let me figure out which parts of the reasoning are essential to keep for future steps. The user wants the expression for Γ derived, so the key points should include the integral definition, the integration by parts showing the recursive property, verification with factorial at integers, and convergence conditions.

First, the initial definition of Γ as an integral is crucial. That's in paragraph 4, where it states Γ(z) is defined as the integral from 0 to infinity of t^(z-1) e^(-t) dt. Then, the integration by parts in paragraph 5 shows Γ(z+1) = zΓ(z), which is a key property. Checking Γ(1) equals 1 in paragraph 6 confirms the base case. The connection to factorial in paragraph 6 and 7 with examples for n=1,2,3 is important. Finally, the convergence discussion in the second last paragraph ensures the integral is valid for Re(z) > 0. These parts are all necessary for the derivation and should be marked as keep.

- Paragraph 4, Sentence 2: <keep>Γ(z) = ∫0^∞ t^(z-1) e^(-t) dt for Re(z) > 0</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 8: <keep>Γ(z+1) = z ∫0^∞ t^(z-1) e^(-t) dt = z Γ(z)</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 4: <keep>Γ(1) = ∫0^∞ t^0 e^(-t) dt = ∫0^∞ e^(-t) dt = [-e^(-t)]0^∞ = 0 - (-1) = 1</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 6: <keep>Γ(n) = (n-1)!</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentence 1: <keep>the integral converges because near t=0, t^{z-1} behaves like t^{Re(z)-1}, which is integrable if Re(z) > 0</keep>
