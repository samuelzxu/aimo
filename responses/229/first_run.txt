Alright, let me try to figure out which parts of this long reasoning are essential to keep for future steps. The problem involves percentages of students knowing languages, and the proof uses set theory and inequalities. 

First, the user defines sets E, G, F for English, German, French. The given conditions are |E ∩ G| > 0.9N and |E ∩ F| > 0.9N. The goal is to show |E ∩ G ∩ F| / |G ∩ F| > 0.9.

Key steps include:
1. Defining A = |E ∩ G ∩ F| and B = |(not E) ∩ G ∩ F|, so the target is A/(A+B) > 0.9, leading to A > 9B.
2. Using inclusion-exclusion principle: |E ∩ G ∩ F| > 0.8N from |E ∩ G| + |E ∩ F| - N.
3. Considering the complement sets and bounding X = |(not E) ∩ G ∩ F| < 0.1N using the given 90% conditions.
4. Deriving inequalities to relate Y (E ∩ G ∩ F) and X, ultimately showing Y > 9X by using the bounds on X and inclusion-exclusion results.

Essential parts are where the key inequalities are derived and where X is bounded. Also, the transformation of the target ratio into inequalities and the application of set theory principles are crucial. These steps form the backbone of the proof, so wrapping those in keep tags will preserve necessary context without redundancy.
