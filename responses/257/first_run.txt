Okay, let's go through the reasoning step by step. The problem involves two ladders, each 1 meter long, symmetrically placed on a smooth ground. They are leaning against each other at their upper ends B and C, while the lower ends A and D are on the ground. We need to find the distance AD when B and C lose contact.

First, we recognize the symmetry of the problem. Since the ladders are identical and symmetrically placed, we can model one ladder and apply symmetry. The key is to determine when the normal force between the ladders at points B and C becomes zero.

Using energy conservation, the potential energy decreases as the ladders fall apart, converting to kinetic energy. The potential energy of each ladder depends on the vertical position of its center of mass, which is related to the angle θ each ladder makes with the vertical. By deriving the equations for kinetic and potential energy, we relate the angular velocity to θ.

Next, we analyze the forces acting on one ladder: the normal force at the ground (N), the weight (mg), and the contact force (F) from the other ladder. Using the equations of motion and torque, we express the contact force F in terms of θ. Setting F to zero gives the critical angle θ where contact is lost. Solving this condition leads to cosθ = 2/3.

Finally, using trigonometric relationships, we find the horizontal distance AD when contact is lost. The calculation involves finding sinθ for θ = arccos(2/3), which results in AD = 2√5/3 meters.

The critical steps involve setting up the energy conservation equation, deriving the angular acceleration, and solving for the contact force. The final answer is verified through multiple approaches, confirming the result.
