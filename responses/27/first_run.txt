Okay, let's go through this step by step. The user wants me to identify which tokens in the provided reasoning trace are essential for future steps. The goal is to wrap those tokens with <keep> tags. 

First, the problem involves calculating the rms speed of Be nuclei using ΔE_rms and then estimating T_c. The key steps are: understanding the relation between ΔE_rms and velocity, calculating the velocity, and then using that to find T_c.

Looking at the reasoning, the important parts are where the formulas are derived. For example, when the user connects ΔE_rms to (1/2)kT, which leads to the formula T = 2ΔE_rms/k. That's crucial because it sets up the calculation for T_c.

Then, calculating the mass of the Be nucleus is essential since it's used in the velocity formula. The user converts atomic mass units to kilograms here, so that part should be kept.

Next, the actual substitution of numbers into the velocity formula, like plugging ΔE_rms = 5.54e-17 J and m = 1.49445e-26 kg into V_Be = sqrt(6ΔE_rms/m). This step is critical for getting the numerical result.

Similarly, when calculating T_c using T_c = (m V_Be²)/(3k), the substitution of V_Be's value and the constants is necessary. The user also converts the units step by step here, which is important for accuracy.

Other parts, like initial confusion about BEC temperatures, might not be as crucial once the correct approach is established. The key formulas, substitutions, and numerical computations are the main parts to keep.

Now, I'll go through each paragraph and identify the essential sentences and formulas, making sure they're wrapped in <keep> tags. I'll ensure that all critical equations and substitutions are included, as omitting those could hinder future reasoning steps. 

For instance, in paragraph 4, the derivation of ΔE_rms = (1/2)kT is pivotal. The calculation steps for T and V_Be in subsequent paragraphs must be marked. The mass calculation of Be nuclei is a key constant needed later, so that stays. Also, the final computation steps for V_Be and T_c, along with their numerical results, are essential for the answer.

I need to avoid marking too much. For example, the initial confusion about BEC and high temperatures isn't necessary once the correct approach is chosen. However, the correct equations derived and applied must be retained. Each formula substitution and numerical computation step is critical and should be kept.
