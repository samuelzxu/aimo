Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about an isosceles triangle ABC with AC = BC and angle ACB = 106 degrees. There's a point M inside the triangle such that angle MAC = 7 degrees and angle MCA = 23 degrees. I need to find the measure of angle CMB. Hmm, seems a bit challenging, but let me try to visualize and sketch the triangle first.

Alright, since AC = BC, triangle ABC is isosceles with vertex at C. So points A and B are the base vertices, and C is the apex. The angle at C is 106 degrees, so angles at A and B must each be (180 - 106)/2 = 37 degrees each. Wait, let me confirm: in any triangle, the sum of angles is 180 degrees. So angle at C is 106, so angles at A and B sum to 74 degrees. Since the triangle is isosceles (AC = BC), the base angles are equal. Hence, angles at A and B are each 37 degrees. Yeah, angle BAC = angle ABC = 37 degrees.

Now, point M is inside the triangle such that angle MAC = 7 degrees and angle MCA = 23 degrees. So, from point A, if we look at angle MAC being 7 degrees, that means line AM splits angle BAC into 7 degrees and the remaining angle at A. Let's note that. Original angle at A is 37 degrees, so angle between AM and AB would be 37 - 7 = 30 degrees. Similarly, at point C, angle MCA is 23 degrees, and since AC = BC, perhaps we can find some relations there.

Also, angle ACB is 106 degrees, so angle between MC and CB would be 106 - 23 = 83 degrees. Hmm.

So, summarizing, points and angles:

- Triangle ABC: AC = BC; angles at A and B: 37°, angle at C: 106°.

- Point M is inside ABC such that angle MAC = 7°, angle MCA = 23°.

We have to find angle CMB.

I think the key here is to use Ceva's Theorem. Ceva's Theorem states that for a point M inside triangle ABC, the following holds:

(\frac{\sin \angle BAM}{\sin \angle CAM}) \cdot (\frac{\sin \angle CBM}{\sin \angle ABM}) \cdot (\frac{\sin \angle ACM}{\sin \angle BCM}) = 1.

But let me recall the exact statement. Alternatively, Ceva's condition is:

\[
\frac{\sin \angle BAM}{\sin \angle CAM} \cdot \frac{\sin \angle CBM}{\sin \angle ABM} \cdot \frac{\sin \angle ACM}{\sin \angle BCM} = 1
\]

But maybe more straightforward to use trigonometric Ceva. Additionally, since we have an isosceles triangle, maybe there are congruent triangles or some symmetries we can exploit.

Alternatively, perhaps constructing additional lines or considering reflections.

But first, perhaps try to mark all known angles. Let me list down known angles.

At point A:

- Original angle BAC = 37 degrees.

- Angle MAC = 7 degrees, so remaining angle BAM = 37 - 7 = 30 degrees.

At point C:

- Original angle ACB = 106 degrees.

- Angle MCA = 23 degrees, so angle BCM = 106 - 23 = 83 degrees.

But angle BCM is angle between CB and CM. Is that correct? Wait, at point C, the angles around M would be angle ACM = 23°, and angle BCM would be the remaining angle at C. Hence angle ACM + angle BCM = angle ACB = 106°, so angle BCM = 106° - 23° = 83°. So angle at C between CB and CM is 83°. Got it.

At point B, we know angle ABC is 37°, and if we could find angles involving point M, maybe CBM and ABM. But since at point B, angle ABM + angle CBM = 37 degrees. Similarly, at point M, the lines involved are AM, BM, CM. So maybe using Ceva's theorem.

Alternatively, let's try to apply trigonometric Ceva. The theorem states that concurrency of cevians AM, BM, CM is equivalent to:

\[
\frac{\sin \angle BAM}{\sin \angle CAM} \cdot \frac{\sin \angle CBM}{\sin \angle ABM} \cdot \frac{\sin \angle ACM}{\sin \angle BCM} = 1
\]

Let's substitute the known angles here. From available info:

- angle BAM = 30°, angle CAM = 7°

- angle ACM = 23°, angle BCM = 83°

Now, let the angles at point B:

Let angle CBM = x°, angle ABM = 37° - x°

Similarly, if that is the case, applying Ceva's formula:

(sin 30° / sin 7°) * (sin x / sin (37 - x)) * (sin 23° / sin 83°) = 1

We can compute this equation to solve for x.

Let me compute numerical values step by step.

First, write down the equation:

[ (sin 30° / sin 7°) * (sin x / sin (37° - x)) * (sin 23° / sin 83°) ) ] = 1

Plug in the known sines:

sin 30° = 1/2

sin 7° ≈ 0.121869

sin 23° ≈ 0.390731

sin 83° ≈ 0.992546

Therefore:

( (0.5 / 0.121869 ) * (sin x / sin(37 - x)) * (0.390731 / 0.992546) ) ≈ 1

Compute first constant:

0.5 / 0.121869 ≈ 4.098

Second fraction: 0.390731 / 0.992546 ≈ 0.3936

Multiply these two: 4.098 * 0.3936 ≈ 1.613

So this gives:

1.613 * (sin x / sin(37 - x)) ≈ 1

Therefore,

(sin x / sin(37° - x)) ≈ 1 / 1.613 ≈ 0.620

So,

sin x ≈ 0.620 * sin(37° - x)

Hmm, now we need to solve sin x = 0.620 * sin(37° - x)

Let me write this equation:

sin x = 0.620 sin(37 - x)

Let me use degrees for calculation.

Expand sin(37 - x):

sin(37 - x) = sin37 cosx - cos37 sinx

Thus:

sin x = 0.620 [ sin37 cosx - cos37 sinx ]

Let sin37 ≈ 0.6019, cos37 ≈ 0.7986

So substitute:

sin x = 0.620 [ 0.6019 cosx - 0.7986 sinx ]

This becomes:

sinx = 0.620 * 0.6019 cosx - 0.620 * 0.7986 sinx

Compute constants:

0.620 * 0.6019 ≈ 0.373

0.620 * 0.7986 ≈ 0.495

Therefore:

sinx = 0.373 cosx - 0.495 sinx

Bring all terms to left:

sinx + 0.495 sinx - 0.373 cosx = 0

=> 1.495 sinx - 0.373 cosx = 0

Divide both sides by cosx:

1.495 tanx - 0.373 = 0

Hence,

tanx = 0.373 / 1.495 ≈ 0.2495

Thus, x ≈ arctan(0.2495) ≈ 14 degrees. Check arctan(0.25) is approximately 14.03 degrees, so yes, close to 14°.

Therefore, angle CBM ≈ 14°, and angle ABM ≈ 37 - 14 ≈ 23°. Let me check if this makes sense.

Alternatively, maybe exact value, but given that we approximated, are we certain?

Wait, was x angle CBM? Yes. So, once we have angle CBM = 14°, then angle ABM = 23°, assuming x=14°.

But let's check if substituting back the values:

Let me compute the ratio:

For x = 14°,

sin14 ≈ 0.2419,

sin(37 -14)= sin23≈0.3907,

so sinx / sin(37 -x)=0.2419 / 0.3907≈0.620. Which matches 0.620 as above. So seems correct. Therefore, conclusion, angle CBM ≈14°, angle ABM≈23°.

But to get precise answer? Hmm, maybe we need an exact answer here. Now, but maybe x is exactly 14°, giving the angle measures as integers? Let me check.

Alternatively, if x = 14°, then angle CBM=14°, angle ABM=23°.

So with these angles, perhaps there is more exactness here. So, perhaps that suggests angle CMB is the value we need to find.

Wait, now, with points as per configurations, the angles at M are crucial. We need angle CMB. How to find angle CMB?

From point M's perspective, angle at M between points C and B is angle CMB. To compute angle CMB, we might need information about the triangle CMB.

Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Sines or Law of Cosines in triangle CMB. But we need some side lengths or other angles. Perhaps this is necessary.

Alternatively, consider the full triangle. Since we know certain angles, maybe setting coordinates. Assign coordinates to the triangle ABC and then compute coordinates for point M and use coordinates to compute the angle.

That might be a viable approach. Let me try that.

First, set coordinate system:

Let me place point C at the origin (0,0).

Since AC = BC, and angle ACB = 106°, we can position the triangle such that AC and BC are equal legs with angle between them 106°, at the origin.

So, let me set point C at (0,0). Let points A and B lie on the plane such that CA = CB = some length, say 1 for simplicity, so AC=1, CB=1, with angle at C being 106°, then coordinates:

Point A can be at (cos(theta), sin(theta)), and point B at (cos(theta), -sin(theta)), with theta = (180° - 106°)/2 = 37°, but wait, that reasoning might not fit.

Wait, angle at point C is 106°, so the angle between vectors CA and CB is 106°. If we place point C at (0,0), point A at (1,0), then point B would be at (cos(106°), sin(106°)), but then CB length is 1, CA length is 1, angle at C is 106°.

Wait, but typically, to place a triangle with two sides of length 'a' with angle between them 'theta', in coordinates:

Place point C at (0,0).

Point A at (a, 0).

Point B at (a*cos(theta), a*sin(theta)).

But in this case, angle between AC and BC is 106°, so theta = 106°, but since AC = BC, placing them both at equal length.

Hmm, perhaps we can take AC=BC=1 for simplicity, then coordinates are:

Point C: (0,0)

Point A: (1,0)

Point B: (cos(106°), sin(106°)) ≈ (cos(106°), sin(106°)) but that would make AB distance computed accordingly.

But perhaps setting AC = BC = 1 might complicate other sides, but maybe manageable.

Alternatively, we can set coordinate system such that point C is at (0,0), point A at (1,0), and point B somewhere in the plane. Then, given angle at C is 106°, meaning angle between vectors CA and CB is 106°, so the coordinates.

Wait, vector CA is (1,0), vector CB is (cos(106°), sin(106°)) assuming they have the same length.

But since AC = BC, yes, that's correct. Thus, with C at (0,0), point A (1,0), point B at (cos(106°), sin(106°)).

Thus, coordinates:

C: (0,0)

A: (1,0)

B: (cos(106°), sin(106°)) ≈ (cos(106°), sin(106°)).

But, given that we can calculate coordinates for points A and B. Then, we need to find coordinates for point M such that angle MAC =7°, and angle MCA=23°. How can we find coordinates for M?

Perhaps by finding intersection points of two lines constructed from the given angles. That is, from point A, construct a line making 7° with AC towards the interior, and from point C, construct a line making 23° with AC towards point M.

Wait, angle MAC=7°, meaning from point A, line AM makes 7° with AC. Wait, but angle MAC is at A. Hmmm.

Wait, angle MAC =7°, that is the angle between MA and AC at point A. No, wait, angle at A: between MA and BA, since angle MAC is at A between MA and CA? Wait, angle MAC is the angle between MA and CA. Since A is at (1,0), angle MAC=7°, meaning that the line AM is inclined at 7° from CA.

Wait, I need to think carefully. Let me clarify: angle MAC is at point A between MA and CA.

Since CA is the side from C to A, i.e., in coordinates, pointing from C(0,0) to A(1,0). So CA is along the positive x-axis.

Angle MAC is formed at A between MA and CA, so between MA and the positive x-axis. Since point M is inside the triangle, the line MA would form an angle of 7° above the line CA at point A.

Therefore, from point A, heading towards M, the line MA is making 7° above the line CA (i.e., the x-axis). Therefore, line MA is going upward from A at 7° relative to the x-axis. So, its slope would be tan(7°). Therefore, equation of line AM is y = tan(7°)(x - 1).

Similarly, angle MCA=23°: at point C, angle between MC and CA. Since angle at C between AC and MC is 23°, meaning from point C, line CM makes 23° from CA (the x-axis), pointing towards M inside the triangle. Thus, line CM has angle 23° from x-axis. Hence, equation of line CM is y = tan(23°)x.

Therefore, point M is at the intersection of lines:

AM: y = tan(7°)(x - 1)

CM: y = tan(23°)x

Solving these equations:

Set tan(23°)x = tan(7°)(x - 1)

Therefore:

tan(23°)x = tan(7°)x - tan(7°)

Bring all terms to left: [tan(23°) - tan(7°)]x = - tan(7°)

Therefore,

x = -tan(7°) / [tan(23°) - tan(7°)]

Compute numerator: -tan(7°) ≈ -0.12278

Denominator: tan(23°) - tan(7°) ≈ 0.42447 - 0.12278 ≈ 0.30169

Hence,

x ≈ (-0.12278) / 0.30169 ≈ -0.407

Wait, but x-coordinate of point M is negative? That's a problem because point M is supposed to be inside triangle ABC, which is in the positive x and positive y (for B) regions. Hmm, this suggests something's wrong with my reasoning.

Wait a second, lines AM and CM intersect at point M inside triangle ABC. If x computed is negative, that would place M outside the triangle towards the left of point C (at x=0). Which contradicts the given that M is inside the triangle. Therefore, likely my setup is incorrect.

Where's the mistake here?

Let me re-examine the angle interpretations. At point A, angle MAC=7°. If line MA makes 7° with CA (x-axis), then going upwards from A(1,0) at 7°, towards M. So AM is going to slope downward from A(1,0) not upward because with a positive angle from the x-axis to AM into an internal point. Wait, perhaps my angle is directed the wrong way.

Wait, angle MAC=7°, which is the angle between CA and MA at point A. Since CA is going from A to C in the direction towards (-1,0). Wait, point C is at (0,0) as I set. From point A(1,0), the vector AC is towards (-1,0) direction. So angle of 7° between vectors AC and AM at point A.

If angle MAC=7°, then direction of AM is 7° above the line AC (towards the upper side of the triangle. Wait, given that in coordinate system with C at (0,0), A at (1,0), and B somewhere in the first quadrant (from point C; but actually with this coordinate system, as angle at C is 106°, points A is at (1,0), B is at (cos(106°), sin(106°))).

Wait, cos(106°) is approximately cos(180°-74°)= -cos(74°)≈-0.2756, sin(106°)= sin(74°)≈0.9613. Therefore, point B would be at (-0.2756, 0.9613). So triangle ABC has coordinates:

A: (1, 0)

B: (-0.2756, 0.9613)

C: (0,0)

But if that's the case, then connecting the points C(0,0) to A(1,0), and C(0,0) to B(-0.2756,0.9613), and A to B. Then inside this triangle, point M is inside such that from A, angle MAC is7°, and from point C, angle MCA is23°.

But earlier, I set line AM as making 7° with CA. Since CA at point A is along the direction from A to C, which is towards (-1,0). Hence, from point A(1,0), which is looking towards C(0,0), the line AC is towards the left. Hence, angle MAC=7° is measured with respect to AC at A.

Thus, since angle between MA and AC at A is7°, with M inside the triangle. Therefore, line AM is deviating 7° upwards from AC. Therefore, from point A(1,0), directions:

Left along AC is towards (-1,0). Upwards from AC would be positive y direction (since in coordinate system, y-axis is upwards). So from point A(1,0), if I turn 7° upwards from AC direction, which is left along x-axis, that would be angle 180°-7°=173° from positive x-axis? Wait, no.

Wait, orientation is key. At point A, side AC is towards the left (from A's perspective). So angle MAC is 7°, so the line MA is 7° above the line AC (if looking from point A towards C). So from point A, left direction is along AC, so 7° above left would be angle of 180° -7°=173° from positive x-axis. But in standard coordinates, angles are measured from positive x-axis counter-clockwise. So if line MA is making 7° above AC, which is the left direction, that translates to heading 180° -7° from positive x-axis.

Therefore, angle of 173°. So line AM would have a slope of tan(173°). But tan(173°)≈tan(180° -7°)= -tan(7°)≈-0.12278. Thus, equation of AM is (y -0) = -0.12278(x -1).

Alternatively, if coordinates are accurate, then from point A(1,0), angle between MA and AC is7°, which is equivalent to the direction of line MA being 7° above AC. Since AC from A is towards negative x-axis (left), so 7° above would be 180 -7 =173 degrees from positive x-axis. So the equation of line AM is parametrized by this angle.

Given point A(1,0), the line at 173° from positive x-axis would have slope tan(173°)=tan(180-7)= -tan(7)≈-0.12278. Therefore, its equation is y = -0.12278 (x -1). Because starting from A(1,0), going at slope -0.12278.

Similarly, from point C(0,0), angle MCA=23°, which is the angle between line CM and CA. Since CA is along positive x-axis (from C to A). Angle MCA is23°, so line CM is at 23° above CA (positive x-axis). Therefore, direction of CM is 23°, so equation y=tan(23)x≈0.42447x.

Then, intersection of CM and AM gives point M.

So, to find coordinates of point M, solve:

CM: y = 0.42447x

AM: y = -0.12278x + 0.12278

Thus:

0.42447x = -0.12278x + 0.12278

=> 0.42447x + 0.12278x = 0.12278

=> 0.54725x =0.12278

x≈0.12278/0.54725≈0.2243

Therefore, x≈0.2243, then y≈0.42447*0.2243≈0.09537

Hence, coordinates of M are ≈(0.2243,0.09537)

Then, now we need to compute angle CMB.

Points:

C is at (0,0)

M is at (0.2243,0.09537)

B is at (-0.2756,0.9613)

So vector from M to C: C - M = (-0.2243, -0.09537)

Vector from M to B: B - M = (-0.2756 -0.2243, 0.9613 -0.09537) = (-0.4999, 0.8659)

Angle at M between vectors MC and MB.

But wait, angle CMB is the angle at M between points C and B. Wait, sorry, angle at CMB is angle at M between C and B? No, angle CMB is the angle at M between points C and B? Wait, no. In angle CMB, the vertex is at M, but that can't be. Wait no, vertices are in order C-M-B, so angle CMB is angle at M between C and B? Wait, actually no. In angle notation, "CMB" is angle at M between points C, M, B. Wait, no. Typically, angle CMB is the angle at M between points C and B. Wait, no. To confirm, angle at M created by lines MC and MB. So it's indeed angle CMB is an angle at M, but that seems non-standard. Wait, angles are denoted with middle letter at the vertex. So angle CMB would be angle at M. So maybe "CMB" means angle at M, so denoted ∠CMB.

But perhaps an abbreviation. Alternatively, maybe there's a confusion. Actually, angle CMB is the angle at B?? Wait no. If someone says angle CMB, typically it's angle at M formed by the lines C to M and B to M. So vertex is at M.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the question is "Find the number of degrees in angle CMB." So according to the notation, angle CMB should be the angle at vertex M between C and B. Which can be calculated via vectors.

Alternatively, maybe angle at point B between C and M? No. Based on notation, angle CMB would at M, as the middle letter.

Hence, to compute ∠CMB, which is angle at M between points C, M, B. So to compute ∠CMB, we need vectors from M to C and from M to B.

Given points C(0,0), M(0.2243,0.09537), B(-0.2756,0.9613). So coordinates:

From M:

Coordinates of MC: C - M = (-0.2243, -0.09537)

Coordinates of MB: B - M = (-0.4999, 0.86593)

To find angle ∠CMB (at M) between vectors MC and MB. Which can be calculated using dot product:

cosθ = (MC ⋅ MB) / (|MC| |MB|)

First, compute MC ⋅ MB:

(-0.2243)(-0.4999) + (-0.09537)(0.86593)

≈ (0.1121) + (-0.0826)

≈ 0.0295

Compute |MC|:

√[(-0.2243)^2 + (-0.09537)^2] ≈ √[0.0503 + 0.0091] ≈ √0.0594 ≈0.2437

Compute |MB|:

√[(-0.4999)^2 + (0.86593)^2] ≈√[0.2499 + 0.7500]≈√1.0≈1.0

Therefore,

cosθ≈0.0295/(0.2437*1.0)≈0.0295/0.2437≈0.1209

Thus, angle θ ≈ arccos(0.1209)≈83.0 degrees.

Hmm, so angle CMB is approx83 degrees? Wait, but 83.0 degrees is exactly the same as angle at point C, angle BCM is 83 degrees, could that be a coincidence?

Wait, but problem states M is inside the triangle, and so angle computations lead us to angle at M being around 83 degrees. But this would be angle CMB. So, maybe the answer is 83 degrees? However, this seems a bit straightforward. Alternatively, is there a mistake in calculation?

Wait, but in the dot product calculation:

Wait, MC ⋅ MB = (−0.2243)(−0.4999) + (−0.09537)(0.86593)

First term: 0.2243*0.4999≈0.1121

Second term: -0.09537*0.86593≈-0.0826

Adding them: 0.1121 -0.0826=0.0295. Correct.

|MC|=√[(-0.2243)^2 + (-0.09537)^2]=√[0.0503 +0.0091]=√0.0594≈0.2437

|MB|=√[(-0.4999)^2 + (0.86593)^2]=√[0.2499 +0.75]=√0.9999≈1.0

So approximately compute the cosine.

arccos(0.0295/(0.2437*1.0)).

0.0295 /0.2437=0.1209 which is approximate.

So arccos(0.1209)= approx 83 degrees.

Alternatively, use exact value since given answer probably needs to be integer. 83 degrees makes sense?

Wait, but earlier from Ceva calculation, we found angle CBM=14 degrees, and angle CMB=83 degrees. But looks the same as angle BCM. Is that a possible conclusion?

Alternatively, perhaps this is an application of the trigonometric Ceva theorem that led us to angle CBM=14°, and other given angles, and then somehow triangle CMB being supplementary? Alternatively, perhaps due to the specific angle measures? Wait, angle CMB is 83°, but angle BCM was determined as angle between CB and CM which is 83°, so a triangle with sides such that angle CMB equals angle at point C.

This raises the question whether triangle CMB is isoceles? Because if angle CMB= angle BCM =83°, then sides opposite those angles would be equal. But in this case, length CM and CB/CM?

But CB is length CB. Earlier, we set CA and CB each to be length 1. So, here, with point B at (-0.2756,0.9613), CB= sqrt[(-0.2756)^2 + (0.9613)^2]≈sqrt[0.0759+0.9241]=sqrt[1.0]=1.0. So CB=1, which makes sense as we set it as AC=BC=1. Meanwhile, distance from C to M?

Coordinates of M(0.2243,0.09537), so distance CM= sqrt[(0.2243)^2 + (0.09537)^2)≈sqrt[0.0503 +0.0091]=sqrt[0.0594]= approx0.2437. Then CM≈0.2437, CB=1.0.

If angle at M is 83°, angle at B is? Wait, we already calculated angles in triangle CMB? Let's calculate again.

In triangle CMB:

Points: C(0,0), M(0.2243, 0.09537), B(-0.2756,0.9613)

Side CB: 1.0

Side CM: approx0.2437

Side BM: distance between M and B, for earlier coordinates was approx1.0, but we need precise.

Wait, wait:

Distance from B to M: B(-0.2756,0.9613) to M(0.2243,0.09537):

Δx=0.2243 - (-0.2756)=0.4999≈0.5

Δy=0.09537 -0.9613=-0.8659

So distance BM= sqrt[(0.5)^2 + (-0.866)^2]=sqrt[0.25+0.750]=sqrt[1.0]=1.0

Ah! So BM=1.0, and CB=1.0 as sides. So in triangle CMB:

CB=1.0, BM=1.0。So triangle CMB is isoceles with CB=BM=1. Then angles: angle CMB=8 3°, angle BCM=83°, which would make angle at B to be 14° (since the sum of angles is 180°). But wait: CB=BM=1.0, so triangle CMB is isoceles with CB=BM.

Therefore, angle at C, angle BCM= angle MCB(the base angles)?Wait, CB=BM=1.0, so this would mean that angles at C and M equal? But in our case angle at C is angle BCM=83°, angle at M is angle CMB we compute as approx83°, which would indeed indicate sides opposite those angles BM and CB equal. Hmm, since angle at C is83°, which is opposite BM, which is of length1.0 equal to CB.

Wait, yes. Law of Sines states:

BM /s angle C = CB / sin angle M ; since BM=CB, so sin angle C = sin angle M. angle c=83°, so sin angle M= sin83°, therefore angle M=83°, exactly. Hence, triangle CMB is isoceles with CB=BM, 1=1, leading to angle at M equals angle at C?

But angle at C was angle BCM=83°, angle at M was 83°, making angle at B: 180 - 83 -83=14° degrees.

Earlier, from Ceva calculations, we deduced angle CBM=14°, and angle at B in triangle CMB is indeed14°, which is the same. Hence, this is consistent.

So that makes triangle CMB: CB=BM=1,angles at C and M:83°, angle at B:14°.

Therefore, angle CMB=83°. Therefore, answer is\boxed{83} degrees.

But confirm once again. Because the problem says in triangle ABC, which is isoceles with AC=BC. But wait AC=BC=1 in my coordinate setup, therefore triangle in coordinates could have BC=1, AC=1. But does the problem state AC=BC? Yes, problem stated: "Triangle ABC is isosceles with AC=BC and ∠ACB=106°."

Hence yes, AC=BC.

In my coordinates, A(1,0), C(0,0),B(cos106°, sin106°). As such length AC=1, BC=1 as we've confirmed.

Given these, calculated that BM=1.0, which equals BC=1.0. Therefore, yes, triangle CMB is isoceles with CM=CB?

Wait, no, triangle CMB in this case sides CB=1.0, BM=1.0, angle at their congruence points.

So sides CB=BM=1. Therefore, triangle isoceles with vertex at B? Wait, no, I's at C and M. Wait, no, triangle CMB has:

- Sides: CB: 1

- CM: computed as approx0.24,

- BM:1

Therefore CB=BM=1, so it is isosceles with CB=BM. Hence angles opposite these sides: angles at M and C will be equal. Therefore, angle at M (CMB) equals angle at C (BCM). From which you have angle at M= angle at C=83°, angle at B=14°, summing to 180°.

Hence yes, angle CMB=83°, matching the coordinate calculation. Therefore, the answer is 83 degrees. Probably the exact answer is 83°, given the computations, both via Ceva leading to angles implying a isoceles triangle with angle at 83 degrees.

Therefore, confident that the measure of angle CMB is 83 degrees.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{83}
