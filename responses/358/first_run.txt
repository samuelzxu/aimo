Okay, I need to figure out which parts of the reasoning are essential for future steps. The user solved the problem using coordinates and Ceva's theorem, leading to the conclusion that angle CMB is 83 degrees. Let's go through the reasoning step by step.

First, the problem setup: triangle ABC is isosceles with AC=BC and angle ACB=106 degrees. Point M is inside with angles MAC=7° and MCA=23°. The key steps include applying Ceva's theorem and coordinate geometry.

Looking at the application of Ceva's theorem: the user sets up the equation with sines of the known angles. The critical part here is the equation itself and the substitution of angles, leading to solving for x (angle CBM). These steps are necessary for future calculations.

Then, using coordinate geometry to place points and calculate intersections. The coordinates of points A, B, C, and M are computed, leading to vectors used to find angle CMB. The vectors and dot product calculation are essential for determining the angle.

The conclusion from both methods (Ceva and coordinates) that angle CMB is 83 degrees is critical. The verification using the Law of Sines in triangle CMB confirms the result. Therefore, the steps involving setting up the equations, solving for x, coordinate calculations, vector analysis, and the final verification are all essential.

Key tokens to keep include the setup of Ceva's equation, substitution of known angles, solving for angle CBM, coordinate assignments, intersection calculations of lines AM and CM, vector dot product calculation for angle CMB, and the isosceles triangle verification.
