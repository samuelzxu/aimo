Okay, let's start by understanding the problem. We have a recurrence relation a_{n+2} = x a_{n+1} + y a_n. For any initial terms a0 and a1, there's a fixed m where a_m, a_{m+1}, a_{m+3} form an arithmetic progression. We need to find all possible y values.

First, the arithmetic progression condition implies 2a_{m+1} = a_m + a_{m+3}. Expanding a_{m+3} using the recurrence relation gives a_{m+3} = x²a_{m+1} + xy a_m + y a_{m+1}. Substituting this into the AP condition leads to coefficients for a_{m+1} and a_m that must both be zero. Solving these gives y = 2 - x² and xy = -1.

Substituting y from the first equation into the second results in the cubic equation x³ - 2x - 1 = 0. Solving this, we find roots x = -1, (1 ± √5)/2. Calculating corresponding y values for each x gives y = 1, (1 - √5)/2, and (1 + √5)/2.

Verification confirms these values satisfy the AP condition for any initial terms, thus they are the valid solutions.

- Paragraph 1, Sentence 5: <keep>we need to find all possible values of $y$.</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 3: <keep>In an AP, the difference between consecutive terms is constant.</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 4: <keep>So, if $a_m, a_{m+1}, a_{m+3}$ are in AP, then the difference between $a_{m+1}$ and $a_m$ should be the same as the difference between $a_{m+3}$ and $a_{m+1}$.</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 5: <keep>That is: $2a_{m+1} = a_m + a_{m+3}$</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 2: <keep>Since this has to hold for any $a_0$ and $a_1$, this must be a property of the recurrence relation itself, not depending on the specific starting values.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 2: <keep>$a_{m+3} = x a_{m+2} + y a_{m+1}$</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 3: <keep>But $a_{m+2} = x a_{m+1} + y a_m$</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 4: <keep>So substituting back: $a_{m+3} = x (x a_{m+1} + y a_m) + y a_{m+1} = x^2 a_{m+1} + x y a_m + y a_{m+1} = (x^2 + y) a_{m+1} + x y a_m$</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, the condition $2a_{m+1} = a_m + a_{m+3}$ becomes: $2a_{m+1} = a_m + (x^2 + y) a_{m+1} + x y a_m$</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 1: <keep>Bringing all terms to one side: $2a_{m+1} - (x^2 + y) a_{m+1} - a_m - x y a_m = 0$</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 2: <keep>Factor terms: $[2 - (x^2 + y)] a_{m+1} + [-1 - x y] a_m = 0$</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 1: <keep>Since this must hold for all possible $a_0$ and $a_1$, the coefficients must both be zero: $2 - x^2 - y = 0$ and $- (1 + x y) = 0$</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 3: <keep>$1. 2 - x^2 - y = 0 \Rightarrow y = 2 - x^2$</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 4: <keep>$2. - (1 + x y) = 0 \Rightarrow 1 + x y = 0 \Rightarrow x y = -1$</keep>

- Paragraph 9, Sentence 3: <keep>Let’s test $x=1$: $1 -2 -1 = -2 \neq 0$.</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 4: <keep>$x=-1$: $(-1)^3 - 2(-1) -1 = -1 +2 -1=0$.</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 1: <keep>Factor out $(x +1)$: $x^3 -2x -1 = (x +1)(x^2 -x -1)$</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 2: <keep>Roots are $x=-1$ and roots of $x^2 -x -1=0$.</keep>

- Paragraph 11, Sentence 3: <keep>For $x=\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$: $x^2 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$, so $y=2 - x^2= \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}$</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 4: <keep>For $x=\frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}$: $x^2 = \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2}$, so $y=2 - x^2= \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentence 1: <keep>Possible values of $y$: $1$, $\frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}$, $\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$</keep>
