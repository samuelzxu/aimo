Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking how many different positive values of \( x \) will make the statement true: there are exactly 2 positive two-digit multiples of \( x \).

First, I need to understand what it means for a number to have exactly two two-digit multiples. A two-digit multiple of \( x \) is any number between 10 and 99 inclusive that is divisible by \( x \). So, I need to find all \( x \) such that there are exactly two numbers in this range that are multiples of \( x \).

Let me start by considering how multiples work. For a given \( x \), the smallest two-digit multiple is the smallest number greater than or equal to 10 that is divisible by \( x \). The largest two-digit multiple is the largest number less than or equal to 99 that is divisible by \( x \). The number of multiples between these two can be calculated using floor division.

The formula for the number of multiples of \( x \) in the range from \( a \) to \( b \) inclusive is \( \left\lfloor \frac{b}{x} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{a-1}{x} \right\rfloor \). Applying this to our case, where \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 99 \), the number of two-digit multiples of \( x \) is \( \left\lfloor \frac{99}{x} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{9}{x} \right\rfloor \).

We need this value to be exactly 2. Let's analyze different ranges of \( x \):

1. **For \( x \geq 10 \)**:
   - Here, \( \left\lfloor \frac{9}{x} \right\rfloor = 0 \) because \( x \) is at least 10.
   - Therefore, the equation simplifies to \( \left\lfloor \frac{99}{x} \right\rfloor = 2 \).
   - This implies \( 2 \leq \frac{99}{x} < 3 \), which rearranges to \( 33 < x \leq 49.5 \).
   - Since \( x \) must be an integer, \( x \) ranges from 34 to 49 inclusive. This gives 16 values (49 - 34 + 1 = 16).

2. **For \( x < 10 \)**:
   - Here, \( \left\lfloor \frac{9}{x} \right\rfloor \) is non-zero, but calculations show that the number of multiples in the two-digit range is much larger than 2. For example, \( x = 1 \) results in 90 multiples, \( x = 2 \) gives 45, and so on.
   - Thus, no values of \( x \) less than 10 will satisfy the condition.

After verifying that values from 34 to 49 indeed have exactly two multiples in the two-digit range (for example, \( x = 34 \) has multiples 34 and 68, \( x = 49 \) has multiples 49 and 98), we conclude there are 16 such values.

Thus, the number of different positive values of \( x \) is \(\boxed{16}\).
