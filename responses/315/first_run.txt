Okay, I need to figure out which parts of the reasoning are essential for future steps. Let's start by looking at the problem and the given solution.

The question involves three inverse trigonometric functions added together with coefficients. The solution process involves several key steps: defining angles θ, φ, and ψ for each term, finding relationships between these angles, substituting them, and simplifying.

First, the user defines θ as the arccos term. They compute sin θ and find it's π over sqrt(2 + π²), which leads to the realization that sin(2θ) equals the argument of the inverse sine term (φ). This is crucial because it connects φ and θ. The conclusion that φ = π - 2θ is a critical relationship here.

Next, for the tan⁻¹ term (ψ), they find that ψ is complementary to θ because tan(ψ) is the reciprocal of tan(θ). So ψ = π/2 - θ. This is another essential relationship.

Substituting these relations into the original expression and simplifying causes the θ terms to cancel out, leaving 3π/4. The numerical verification confirms this.

So, the key steps involve defining the angles, deriving their relationships (φ = π - 2θ and ψ = π/2 - θ), substituting them into the expression, and simplifying. The parts where these relationships are established are essential. Also, the substitution and algebraic simplification steps are important to retain because they show how the terms cancel out.

The early steps calculating sin²θ and sin²φ help in establishing the connection between φ and θ. The recognition that sin(2θ) matches the argument for φ's inverse sine function is vital. Similarly, noticing the reciprocal relationship between tan(ψ) and tan(θ) is key.

Therefore, the essential tokens include the definitions of θ, φ, ψ, the derivations of their relationships, substitution into the original expression, and the simplification showing cancellation. The numerical check at the end supports the conclusion but might be less critical for the logical flow, but since it's part of verifying the answer, it should be included.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 1: <keep>First, I recall that inverse trigonometric functions can sometimes be related to each other, especially if their arguments are connected. Maybe there's a way to express some terms in terms of angles that would simplify the addition.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 1: <keep>Starting with the first term: \(\frac{3}{2} \cos ^{-1} \sqrt{\frac{2}{2+\pi^{2}}}\). Let me denote \(\theta = \cos^{-1} \sqrt{\frac{2}{2+\pi^{2}}}\). Then, \(\cos \theta = \sqrt{\frac{2}{2+\pi^{2}}}\).</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 4: <keep>Therefore, \(\theta = \sin^{-1} \left( \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2 + \pi^2}} \right)\).</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 6: <keep>Third term is \(\tan^{-1} \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\pi}\). Let's denote \(\psi = \tan^{-1} \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\pi}\). So, \(\tan \psi = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\pi}\).</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 1: <keep>From θ, we had: \(\cos \theta = \sqrt{\frac{2}{2 + \pi^2}}\), so squaring both sides, \(\cos^2 \theta = \frac{2}{2 + \pi^2}\), which implies \(\sin^2 \theta = \frac{\pi^2}{2 + \pi^2}\).</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 6: <keep>\(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta = 2 * \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2 + \pi^2}} * \sqrt{\frac{2}{2 + \pi^2}} = \frac{2\pi\sqrt{2}}{2 + \pi^2}\).</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 1: <keep>So, \(\sin(2θ) = \frac{2\sqrt{2}\pi}{2 + \pi^2} = \sin \phi\).</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 2: <keep>Given that φ is the principal value of inverse sine, which is in [-π/2, π/2], but since the argument is positive, φ is in [0, π/2].</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 4: <keep>Therefore, if sin(phi) = sin(2θ), and both phi and 2θ are in [0, π] where sine is positive, then phi = 2θ or phi = π - 2θ.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 3: <keep>But phi is an arcsine, so phi is in [0, π/2]. Therefore, phi = pi - 2theta.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 1: <keep>tan(psi) = sqrt(2)/pi. Which is reciprocal. So tan(theta) = pi / sqrt(2) and tan(psi) = sqrt(2)/pi. So this suggests that theta + psi = pi/2, because if tan(theta) = cot(psi) = tan(pi/2 - psi), so theta = pi/2 - psi.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 1: <keep>Original expression: (3/2)theta + (1/4)phi + psi</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 2: <keep>Substitute: (3/2)theta + (1/4)(pi - 2theta) + (pi/2 - theta)</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 6: <keep>So the entire expression simplifies to 3pi/4.</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 3: <keep>Convert 3pi/4 to radians: 3pi/4 ≈ 2.3562 rad. That's the same as above. So it checks out numerically!</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, the answer is 3π/4.</keep>
