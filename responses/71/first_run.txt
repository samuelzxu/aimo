Okay, so I need to figure out which parts of the reasoning are essential to keep for future steps. Let's start by breaking down the thought process.

First, the problem involves finding the sum of the absolute values of the roots of a cubic polynomial. Vieta's formulas are used to relate the coefficients to the roots. The key equations here are:
1. a + b + c = 0 (since the coefficient of x² is 0)
2. ab + bc + ac = -2011 (from the x term)
3. abc = -m (from the constant term)

These are fundamental because they set up the relationships between the roots. The next step involves manipulating these equations, particularly using the fact that a + b = -c to substitute into the other equations. This leads to the equation ab - c² = -2011, which is critical for forming the quadratic equation whose roots are a and b.

The discriminant of this quadratic must be a perfect square, leading to the Diophantine equation 3c² + k² = 8044. Solving this requires recognizing that 2011 is a prime number and that the equation can be transformed by substituting variables (c=2d, k=2e) to simplify it into 3d² + e² = 2011. 

The breakthrough comes when testing values for d and e, finding that d=5 and e=44 satisfies the equation, leading to c=10. Substituting back, the quadratic equation gives the roots a=39 and b=-49. Checking the sum of absolute values confirms the answer.

Throughout the process, key steps include establishing Vieta's formulas, forming the quadratic equation, solving the Diophantine equation, and verifying the solution. These parts are essential for reconstructing the solution and must be retained. Other parts, such as verifying primes or testing other potential roots, provide context but aren't strictly necessary once the main solution path is established.
