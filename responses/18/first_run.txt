Okay, let me figure out which parts of the reasoning are essential to keep for future steps. The user's goal is to identify the necessary tokens that must be retained for the continuation of reasoning. The answer is (7,5), but the key is how we arrived there. Let's go through the reasoning:

First, understanding the problem: subgroup H generated by three elements, and needing to express it as H_{xy} generated by (0,x) and (1,y). The critical part is recognizing that H_{xy} has elements (b, ax + by), which led to analyzing congruences for the generators of H.

The key steps are:
1. Determining that H_{xy} consists of elements (b, a x + b y) with a, b integers.
2. Recognizing that H must satisfy congruence relations for each generator: 8 ≡3y mod x, -1≡4y mod x, and 4≡5y mod x.
3. Solving the system of congruences by finding x and y, leading to x=7 and y=5 through modular arithmetic and checking divisibility.

Essential parts are the setup of congruences and solving them. The step where x is found as a divisor of 35 and 28, narrowing down to x=7, and solving for y≡5 mod7 is crucial. Also, verifying that (0,7) and (1,5) are in H by solving linear combinations is necessary to confirm the solution.

Parts to keep would include defining H_{xy}, setting up the congruence equations, solving for x=7 and y=5, and the verification steps. These steps are essential to reproduce the answer or continue reasoning. The initial explanation of Z^2 subgroups provides context but might be redundant if the focus is on the critical calculations. However, the equations and their solutions are vital.
