Okay, let me work through this problem step by step. We need to find the minimal value of f(X) = AX + BX + CX + DX for any point X in space, where ABCD is a tetrahedron with given edge lengths. The answer should be in the form m√n, and we need to find m + n.

First, observe that the tetrahedron is a disphenoid since all opposite edges are equal. A disphenoid has congruent faces and certain symmetries. Recognizing the symmetry is crucial because it suggests the minimal value might be achieved at the centroid or another symmetric point.

Next, setting up coordinates for the tetrahedron is essential. By assigning vertices symmetrically around the origin, we can leverage the symmetry to simplify calculations. The vertices are placed as follows:
- A = (√482, √194, √2)
- B = (-√482, -√194, √2)
- C = (-√482, √194, -√2)
- D = (√482, -√194, -√2)

The centroid (and symmetry center) of the tetrahedron is at the origin (0,0,0). Calculating the distance from the origin to each vertex, we find each distance is √678. Therefore, the sum of distances from the origin to all four vertices is 4√678.

Verifying potential other points (like vertices or edge midpoints) shows higher sums, confirming the centroid minimizes f(X). The value 4√678 simplifies to m√n with m=4 and n=678. Summing these gives 682.

Key steps:
- Identify tetrahedron as a disphenoid.
- Set up symmetric coordinates.
- Calculate distances from centroid.
- Confirm centroid minimizes the sum.

Final Answer: \boxed{682}
