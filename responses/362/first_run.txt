Okay, I need to figure out which parts of the provided reasoning are essential for future steps. The user wants me to mark the critical tokens using <keep> tags. Let's go through the thinking process step by step.

First, the initial problem understanding is crucial. The user starts by restating the inequality and the conditions. This sets the stage for the proof, so maybe keep that.

Then, they test small cases like m=2 and m=3. These specific examples help verify the inequality and provide insight into the equality conditions. These sections are important because they lead to conjectures about the equality holding when variables are zero or equal. So, those case analyses should be marked.

When they expand the right-hand side for m=3, that's detailed computation. The key result here is recognizing that each pair's inequality leads to non-negative terms, which is fundamental to proving the case. That part might need to be kept.

The discussion about equality cases when variables are equal or one is zero is central to the proof. They use specific examples to conclude that equality occurs when m-1 variables are equal and the rest are zero. These observations are vital and must be retained.

The user employs Hölder's inequality and Power Mean inequality, which are critical to the general proof. The parts explaining how these inequalities apply should be kept.

They also consider normalization (sum x_i =1) to simplify the problem. This technique is a common strategy in inequality proofs, so that section is important.

When analyzing the product term and AM-GM, they show that the product is maximized when variables are equal, but equality in the given inequality requires it to be zero. This contrast is essential for understanding when equality holds.

The induction approach is discussed, though not fully fleshed out. However, the idea of reducing the problem to a lower m by setting a variable to zero is a key insight and should be marked.

The detailed substitution for m=3 and subsequent polynomial analysis might be too specific but shows that the inequality holds between endpoints. This example supports the general case, so it's worth keeping parts of it.

Finally, the conclusion that combines all the insights—equality when variables are zero or m-1 variables are equal and one is zero—is critical and must be retained.

Throughout, the user references previous steps and builds upon them, so the logical flow and key conclusions need to be preserved for future reasoning. Examples for specific m values, applications of inequalities, and normalization are all essential parts.
