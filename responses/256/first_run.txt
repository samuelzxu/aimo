Alright, let me try to figure this out. The problem is about a sequence of numbers x₁ to x₁₀₀ where x₁ is 1/2, and each subsequent term xₙ₊₁ is defined as 1 minus the product of all 100 numbers. Wait, that seems a bit confusing because how can each term depend on all 100 terms including itself? That sounds circular. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again.

It says, "for every n from 1 to 99, xₙ₊₁ = 1 − x₁x₂x₃…x₁₀₀." So, each xₙ₊₁ is 1 minus the product of all x₁ through x₁₀₀. But if that's the case, all terms from x₂ to x₁₀₀ would have to be equal because they're all defined in the same way. Let me suppose that all x₂ to x₁₀₀ are equal to some value y. Then the product P would be x₁ * y⁹⁹ = (1/2)y⁹⁹. According to the definition, each xₙ₊₁ is 1 - P, so y = 1 - (1/2)y⁹⁹. Now, solving this equation y + (1/2)y⁹⁹ = 1. If I plug in y = 0.99, then y⁹⁹ is approximately e⁻¹ ≈ 0.367, so (1/2)*0.367 ≈ 0.184. Adding to y gives 0.99 + 0.184 ≈ 1.174, which is more than 1. That means the actual solution for y must be less than 0.99, which contradicts the problem's claim that x₁₀₀ > 0.99.

Hmm, maybe I made a wrong assumption. Perhaps the problem actually meant that each term xₙ₊₁ is 1 minus the product of the first n terms, not all 100. That makes more sense. Let's test that. If x₁ = 1/2, x₂ = 1 - x₁ = 1/2, x₃ = 1 - x₁x₂ = 3/4, and so on. Each term gets closer to 1 as the product of previous terms becomes very small. So by x₁₀₀, the product P is tiny, making x₁₀₀ = 1 - P very close to 1. To formalize this, consider the product sequence Pₙ = x₁x₂...xₙ. The recurrence for Pₙ is Pₙ₊₁ = Pₙ * (1 - Pₙ). Starting with P₁ = 1/2, P₂ = 1/4, P₃ = 3/16, etc. Each Pₙ decreases and approaches 0, so xₙ₊₁ approaches 1. To show Pₙ ≤ 1/(n+1), use induction. If true for n, then Pₙ₊₁ = Pₙ(1 - Pₙ) ≤ (1/(n+1))(1 - 1/(n+1)) = n/(n+1)² ≤ 1/(n+2). Thus, P₉₉ ≤ 1/100, so x₁₀₀ = 1 - P₉₉ ≥ 0.99. Since P₉₉ is actually less than 1/100, x₁₀₀ > 0.99.
