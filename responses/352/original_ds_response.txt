Okay, so I need to find the area of the region enclosed by the graph of |x - 60| + |y| = |x/4|. Hmm, absolute value equations can sometimes define geometric shapes, maybe a polygon or something with straight edges. Let me start by understanding the equation.

First, the equation is |x - 60| + |y| = |x/4|. I have absolute values on both sides for x and y. To graph this, I might have to consider different cases based on the signs inside the absolute values. But before jumping into cases, let me see if I can simplify or rearrange the equation.

Let me subtract |x - 60| from both sides:

|y| = |x/4| - |x - 60|

Hmm, so |y| equals a combination of absolute values of x. Since |y| is non-negative, the right side must also be non-negative. Therefore, |x/4| - |x - 60| ≥ 0. This gives a restriction on the x-values that will be part of the graph. Maybe this inequality defines the domain where the equation is valid.

So, solving |x/4| - |x - 60| ≥ 0 might help in determining the x-interval(s) over which the equation holds.

Let me write that inequality down:

|x/4| ≥ |x - 60|

This is equivalent to |x|/4 ≥ |x - 60|. Let me square both sides perhaps to eliminate the absolute values? Squaring is a common technique, but need to be careful because squaring inequalities can sometimes flip signs or introduce extraneous solutions if not done properly. However, since both sides are non-negative (as absolute values), squaring should preserve the inequality direction.

So, (x/4)^2 ≥ (x - 60)^2

Compute both sides:

Left side: x2 / 16

Right side: (x - 60)2

Thus:

x2 / 16 ≥ (x - 60)^2

Multiply both sides by 16 to eliminate denominator:

x2 ≥ 16(x - 60)2

Let’s compute the right-hand side:

16(x2 - 120x + 3600) = 16x2 - 1920x + 57600

So inequality becomes:

x2 ≥ 16x2 - 1920x + 57600

Bring all terms to left side:

x2 - 16x2 + 1920x - 57600 ≥ 0

Simplify:

-15x2 + 1920x - 57600 ≥ 0

Multiply both sides by -1 (reversing the inequality sign):

15x2 - 1920x + 57600 ≤ 0

Simplify coefficients by dividing all terms by 15:

x2 - 128x + 3840 ≤ 0

So, we need to solve x2 - 128x + 3840 ≤ 0.

This is a quadratic inequality. Let's find roots first.

Quadratic equation: x2 - 128x + 3840 = 0

We can compute discriminant D = 1282 - 4*1*3840

Compute D:

1282 = (130 - 2)2 = 1302 - 4*130 + 4 = 16900 - 520 + 4 = 16384

Wait, but 128 * 128 = 16384, right? So 128^2 = 16384

So D = 16384 - 15360 = 1024

So roots are x = [128 ± sqrt(1024)] / 2

sqrt(1024) = 32

Thus, x = (128 ± 32)/2 = (160)/2 = 80; or (96)/2 = 48

So, roots at x = 48 and x = 80.

So the quadratic can be factored as (x - 48)(x - 80) ≤ 0.

The quadratic opens upwards (coefficient 1 positive) so the parabola is upward opening. Thus, the inequality (x - 48)(x - 80) ≤ 0 is true between the roots. So solution is when x ∈ [48,80].

Therefore, the domain of x is [48,80]. So within this x interval, the original equation |x - 60| + |y| = |x/4| defines a region. Since it's the absolute value equation, it's symmetric with respect to y-axis (since |y| appears).

Wait, actually, the original equation has |y|, but the right-hand side only involves x.

So for each x in [48,80], we can solve for y.

Given |y| = |x/4| - |x - 60|

So for each x in [48,80], |x/4| - |x - 60| = some non-negative value. Let’s compute this.

But maybe first, let's think about the original equation |x - 60| + |y| = |x/4|. For each x, you can write it as |y| = |x/4| - |x - 60|

Since |x/4| - |x - 60| is non-negative in [48,80], then for each x, the corresponding y is ± ( |x/4| - |x - 60| )

Therefore, the graph will be two functions of x: y = |x/4| - |x - 60| and y = -(|x/4| - |x - 60| ). So it's symmetric across the x-axis.

Thus, if I figure out the equation in the cases for x, and whether (x/4) and (x - 60) are positive or negative. Let's see.

First, our x-domain is [48,80]. Let's split into the intervals or points where the expressions inside the absolute values |x - 60| and |x/4| change sign.

For |x - 60|, the critical point is at x = 60.

For |x/4|, since x >0 in the domain (48 to 80), x/4 is always positive, so |x/4| = x/4.

Therefore, x is in [48,80], so x/4 is in [12,20], which is positive. So |x/4| = x/4.

But |x -60| changes sign at x=60.

Hence, perhaps splitting into two cases: when x ≥ 60, |x -60| = x -60, and when x ≤60, |x -60| = 60 -x.

Therefore, case 1: x in [60,80], meaning |x -60| = x - 60, and |x/4| = x/4.

Case 2: x in [48,60), |x -60| = 60 - x, and |x/4| is still x/4.

Therefore, in each case, we can substitute.

So let me do case 2 first since [48,60):

For x in [48,60):

|x - 60| = 60 - x

Thus, |y| = |x/4| - |x -60| = x/4 - (60 - x) = x/4 -60 + x = (5x/4) -60

So |y| = (5x/4 - 60)

Therefore, y = ±(5x/4 -60). Now, for x in [48,60), compute 5x/4 -60. Let me check if this is positive in [48,60)

At x=48:

5*48/4 -60 = 5*12 -60 =60 -60=0. At x=60, 5*60/4 -60 =75 -60=15. But if x approaches 60 from the left, 5x/4 approaches 75, so this expression goes from 0 to 15 as x goes from 48 to 60. But wait, for x in [48,60), expression 5x/4 - 60 starts at 0 at x=48 and increases up to 15 at x=60. Hmmm, so 5x/4 -60 is negative when x <48, but in our domain, x is [48,80]. So at x=48, it's zero.

Wait, the original equation |x/4| - |x -60| is zero at x=48 and x=80.

But when x is in [48,60), this expression 5x/4 -60 ranges from 0 to 15. So positive, so |y| = that, so y = ±(5x/4 -60)

Therefore, in this case, x from 48 to60, and y is between -(5x/4 -60) and (5x/4 -60). So that forms two lines.

Similarly, for case 1: x in [60,80]:

|x -60| = x -60, and |x/4|=x/4.

Thus, |y|= x/4 - (x -60) =x/4 -x +60= -3x/4 +60

So |y|= -3x/4 +60, which is positive when?

Since x is in [60,80], compute -3x/4 +60. When x=60: -45 +60=15, when x=80: -60 +60=0. So in this interval, it decreases from 15 to 0, which is positive.

So here, |y|= -3x/4 +60, so y= ±(-3x/4 +60). So again, two lines.

So to sum up:

The graph is composed of four lines:

For x from 48 to60:

y=(5x/4)-60 and y= - (5x/4 -60 )

For x from 60 to80:

y= -3x/4 +60 and y= - (-3x/4 +60 ) = 3x/4 -60

But let me check when x=60 in both cases.

At x=60, first case gives y=(5*60)/4 -60=75-60=15 vs second case: y=-3*60/4 +60=-45+60=15. Similarly, the lower part would be -15.

Therefore, the graph is continuous.

Hence, the figure is a polygon that lies between two pieces of lines, and the region enclosed can be found by integrating the vertical distance between upper and lower boundaries over x from 48 to80.

But since upper boundary is composed of two lines: from x=48 to60, it's y=5x/4 -60; from x=60 tox=80, it's y=-3x/4 +60.

Similarly, the lower boundary is the reflection across the x-axis: y=-(5x/4 -60) from 48 to60, and y=3x/4 -60 from60 to80.

But since |y|=..., the region is symmetric about the x-axis, so the area is twice the area from y=0 to y= upper boundary.

Alternatively, since both upper and lower boundaries are accounted for, the area between upper and lower would be 2 times the integral of the upper from x=48 tox=80. Let's verify.

Actually, since |y| gives both positive and negative y, the top half is given by y= |x/4| - |x -60|, and the bottom half is y= - ( |x/4| - |x -60| ).

The total vertical distance between upper and lower boundaries is 2*( |x/4| - |x -60| ). So to get the area, we can integrate this vertical distance from x=48 to x=80.

Alternatively, if you think of the area as being double the integral from48 tox=80 of (|x/4| - |x-60| ) dx.

Wait, yes, exactly, because for each x in that interval, the vertical strip has length 2*(|x/4| - |x -60| ), so integrating that from48 to80 gives total area.

But since we broke down expressions for each region, 48 to60 and60 to80, it might be easier to compute each integral separately.

First, for x between48 to60: |x/4| - |x -60| = x/4 - (60 -x ) =5x/4 -60

Similarly, for x between60 to80: |x/4| - |x -60| = x/4 - (x -60)= -3x/4 +60

Therefore, the area can be written as twice the integral from48 to60 of (5x/4 -60) dx plus twice the integral from60 tox=80of (-3x/4 +60 ) dx

But actually, since we have to integrate over x=48 tox=80 with (upper func - lower func), which is 2*( |x/4| - |x-60| ), so integrating over 48 to80 gives the total area.

Wait, hold on. The integral of the vertical slices would just be integrating (upper - lower ). Which is [ ( |x/4| - |x -60| ) - ( - (|x/4| - |x -60| ) ) ]= 2*( |x/4| - |x -60| ). So integrating that over x=48 tox=80. Therefore, yes, Area = integral from48 to80 of 2*( |x/4| - |x -60| ) dx.

But since between48 to60 and60 to80, the expressions inside the absolute values change.

So split the integral at x=60:

Area = 2* [ integral from48 to60 of (5x/4 -60 ) dx + integral from60 to80 of (-3x/4 +60 ) dx ]

Compute these integrals.

Let me compute the first integral, integral from48 to60 of (5x/4 -60 ) dx

Let me compute the antiderivative:

Integral of5x/4 dx= (5/4)*(x2/2 )= 5x2/8

Integral of -60 dx= -60x

Thus, antiderivative is5x2 /8 -60x + C

Evaluate from48 to60:

At x=60: 5*(60)^2 /8 -60*60=5*3600/8 -3600= 18000/8 -3600=2250 -3600= -1350

At x=48:5*(48)^2 /8 -60*48=5*2304 /8 -2880= 11520 /8 -2880=1440 -2880= -1440

Thus, difference=(-1350) - (-1440)=90

So first integral gives90

Second integral: integral from60 to80 of (-3x/4 +60 ) dx

Compute the antiderivatives:

Integral of-3x/4 dx= (-3/4)*(x2/2 )= -3x2 /8

Integral of60 dx=60x

Antiderivative: -3x2 /8 +60x

Evaluated from60 to80:

At x=80: -3*(80)^2 /8 +60*80= -3*6400 /8 +4800= -2400 +4800=2400

At x=60: -3*(60)^2 /8 +60*60= -3*3600 /8 +3600= -1350 +3600=2250

Thus, difference=2400-2250=150

Hence, the second integral is 150.

So total area=2*(90+150)=2*240=480

Therefore, the area enclosed is480.

But before concluding, let's reevaluate if the initial approach was right.

Alternatively, maybe graphing this figure would help.

Since fromx=48 to60, the upper function is y=5x/4-60, and from60 to80, upper function is-3x/4 +60. Similarly, the lower functions are the negatives: from48-60, y= -5x/4 +60 and60-80,y=3x/4 -60.

But maybe the closed figure is a polygon with vertices whose coordinates can be found by checking intersect corners.

For example, atx=48, y=±(5*48/4 -60)= ±(60 -60)=0, so the point (48,0)

At x=60, in first equation,y=5*60/4 -60=75-60=15, but in next equationwhen x=60,y=-3*60/4 +60= -45+60=15, so point (60,15) and (60,-15)

Atx=80,y=-3*80/4 +60=-60+60 =0, so points(80,0)

Therefore, the figure is a polygon with vertices at (48,0),(60,15);(60,15) connecting tox=80,0)... But wait. Wait, is there an intermediate vertex?

Wait, maybe betweenx=60, but wait not in the equations.

Wait, perhaps not. So it connects (48,0) to (60,15) via a straight line (since equation here is y=5x/4 -60)

Wait, check the slope between (48,0) and (60,15): the slope would be (15 -0)/(60 -48)=15/12=5/4, which is consistent with y=5x/4 -60. Indeed, at48, y=5*48/4 -60=60 -60=0, so yes.

Similarly, from60,15 to80,0. The coordinates: slope would be (0 -15)/(80 -60)=(-15)/20=-3/4. The equation is y= -3x/4 +60. Check at60: y=-3*60/4 +60= -45 +60=15, at80: y=-3*80/4 +60=-60 +60=0. So, yes.

Additionally, the lower part is symmetric: (48,0), (60,-15), then (80,0). Hence, when connected, this figure is a hexagon? Wait, but actually, when we plot (48,0) to (60,15) to (80,0) and then reflect over x-axis to (80,0), back to (60,-15) and (48,0). So this is a quadrilateral: a diamond shape with vertices at (48,0), (60,15),(80,0),(60,-15), back to (48,0).

But wait, actually since the two lines meet at (60,15) and (60,-15). Wait, therefore, actually, the figure is a polygon with four vertices: (48,0), (60,15), (80,0),(60,-15), connected in that order. Thus, it's a convex quadrilateral, symmetrical about the x-axis.

Therefore, alternatively, the area can be calculated as the area of this quadrilateral.

Since it's symmetric about the x-axis, perhaps area is twice the area of the upper part.

The upper part is a triangle? Wait, (48,0),(60,15),(80,0). Let's see:

The upper part connects from (48,0) to (60,15) to (80,0). Perhaps it's a triangle? Wait, (48,0);(60,15);(80,0) those three points, if connected, a triangle?

But with vertices (48,0), (60,15),(80,0). If these three points are connected as per the graph, maybe it's a triangle.

But no, in the original equation, for each x in [48,80], there's a corresponding y. Therefore, in the upper part, from x=48 tox=60, the upper bound is the line from (48,0) to(60,15), and fromx=60 to80, upper bound is from(60,15) to(80,0).

Similarly lower part.

Hence, the figure is a quadrilateral (upper part)+ quadrilateral (lower part). Wait, but top is one connected, the area between each line.

But maybe calculating the area as trapezoid.

But actually, let's compute it as trapezoid.

From x=48 tox=60, there is a linear function from (48,0) to (60,15). Similarly, from60 to80, linear function to(80,0). The bottom part is symmetrical.

Alternatively, using coordinates for vertices:

(48, 0), (60,15), (80, 0), (60,-15). So this is a kite-shaped quadrilateral. Because it's symmetric along the x-axis.

But the same as two triangles above and below the x-axis.

Alternatively, the area can be calculated using coordinates of the vertices. Since it is a quadrilateral, possibly a convex kite shape, we can use shoelace formula.

Let me verify points:

Vertices in order: (48,0), (60,15), (80,0), (60,-15). If we traverse these and close the polygon, the shoelace formula area.

Shoelace formula for coordinates (x1,y1), (x2,y2), ..., (xn,yn):

Area = 1/2 |sum_{i=1 to n} (xi*yi+1 - xi+1*yi) |, with xn+1=x1, yn+1=y1.

So plug in our coordinates:

First, list the coordinates in order:

1: (48,0)

2: (60,15)

3: (80,0)

4: (60,-15)

5: (48,0 )

Compute shoelace sum:

Calculate each xi*yi+1 -xi+1*yi

From 1 to2: (48)(15) - (60)(0)=720 −0=720

From 2 to3:60*0 -80*15=0 -1200= -1200

From 3 to4:80*(-15)−60*0= -1200−0=−1200

From4 to5:60*0 -48*(-15)=0 +720=720

Sum these:

720 -1200 -1200 +720= (720+720) - (1200+1200)=1440 -2400= -960

Take absolute value and multiply by1/2:

Area=(1/2)* | -960 | = 480

So same result. Both methods give480.

Alternatively, maybe decompose into two triangles and a rectangle?

But maybe not. Actually, in the upper part, the trapezoid from (48,0) to60,15 to80,0.

No, the area can be broken as area between two lines.

Alternatively, in the upper part, from x=48 to x=60, the figure is a trapezoid with bases of lengths0 at x=48 and15 atx=60, height 12 (60 -48) and average height (0+15)/2*12=15/2*12=90. Similarly, upper part from60 to80, its a trapezoid with bases15 and0, height20 (80-60=20), so average is (15+0)/2*20=150. Then area is90+150=240, multiply by2 due to lower parts for total area=480. Same result.

Either way, answer is480. So I think the correct answer is480.

**Final Answer**
The area of the enclosed region is \boxed{480}.
