Okay, let me try to figure out which parts of the reasoning are essential to keep. The problem is about three planets with periods 60, 84, and 140 years needing to find when they'll be collinear again. The thinking process involves understanding collinearity, orbital periods, angles, and using LCM concepts. 

First, the key steps involve converting periods into angular speeds, determining when angles differ by 180 degrees modulo 360, which leads to equations involving t*(1/P_i - 1/P_j) being half-integers. Then, calculating synodic periods and LCMs of these adjusted periods.

Important parts would be where the user factors the periods to find LCM, but then realizes collinearity can happen at half-periods. Then, calculating pairwise synodic periods divided by 2, leading to 105, 52.5, and 105. Finding LCM of those gives 105.

Also crucial is verifying with examples, like t=105 leading to angles 270°, 90°, 270°, which indeed are collinear. Finally, reconciling different approaches to confirm 105 is correct.

Key sentences and equations explaining the transformations and LCM calculations are essential. Also, the realization that collinearity doesn't require full LCM but half due to 180-degree alignment.
