Okay, so I need to figure out which parts of this long reasoning are essential to keep for future steps. Let me start by understanding the problem and the solution provided.

The problem is about finding the number of sequences of positive integers defined by a recurrence relation such that a specific term a_{2010} is less than or equal to 2^{2012}. The solution goes through several steps: solving the recurrence relation, finding constraints on initial terms, translating the condition on a_{2010} into an inequality, and then counting the number of valid initial pairs (a1, a2).

Key steps in the reasoning:

1. **Solving the recurrence relation**:
   - The characteristic equation leads to the general solution a_n = A + B*2^n.
   - Expressing A and B in terms of a1 and a2.

2. **Determining constraints for all terms to be positive integers**:
   - Analyzing that a2 must be ≥ a1 to avoid negative terms in the sequence.

3. **Expressing a_{2010} in terms of a1 and a2**:
   - Substituting n=2010 into the closed-form solution.
   - Rewriting a_{2010} = a1 + (a2 - a1)(2^{2009} - 1).

4. **Formulating the inequality**:
   - Translating a_{2010} ≤ 2^{2012} into an inequality involving a1 and a2.

5. **Counting valid pairs (a1, a2)**:
   - Introducing substitutions (y = a2 - a1, x = a1) to transform the problem into an integer solution count.
   - Calculating the maximum possible values for y and summing over possible values.

The critical sections that need to be kept are those that derive the key equations and steps necessary to arrive at the final count. This includes the closed-form solution of the recurrence, the transformation into the inequality for a_{2010}, and the summation process leading to the final answer.

Important parts to mark:

- Derivation of the general solution.
- The closed-form expression for a_{2010}.
- The inequality derived for a_{2010} in terms of a1 and a2.
- Substitutions to count solutions.
- Summation leading to the final answer.

I need to make sure these key steps are preserved for future reasoning, even if some intermediate algebra or examples are omitted. The final answer is heavily dependent on these critical equations and transformations.
