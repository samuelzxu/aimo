Alright, let me tackle this problem step by step. The question is about finding the mean of a set S when adding two different numbers changes the mean by specific amounts. 

First, let's set up the variables. Let the mean of S be μ, the sum of elements in S be Σ, and the number of elements be n. So μ = Σ/n. 

Adding 1 to S changes the mean. The new mean is (Σ + 1)/(n + 1), which is 13 less than the original mean. That gives the equation:
(Σ + 1)/(n + 1) = μ - 13.

Similarly, adding 2001 increases the mean by 27:
(Σ + 2001)/(n + 1) = μ + 27.

Substituting Σ = μn into both equations simplifies them. For the first equation:
(μn + 1)/(n + 1) = μ - 13.
Multiplying both sides by (n + 1) and simplifying gives μ = 13n + 14.

For the second equation:
(μn + 2001)/(n + 1) = μ + 27.
After similar steps, this leads to μ = 1974 - 27n.

Setting the two expressions for μ equal to each other:
13n + 14 = 1974 - 27n.
Solving for n gives n = 49. Plugging back into μ = 13n + 14 gives μ = 651.

Finally, checking the solution with the original conditions confirms it's correct.
