Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is about the effect of temperature on the equilibrium constant K in terms of entropy changes for exothermic and endothermic reactions. 

First, I need to recall the thermodynamic equations involved. The van 't Hoff equation relates the change in ln K with temperature to the enthalpy change (ΔH°). However, the problem specifically asks about entropy changes. The Gibbs free energy equation, ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°, connects these concepts, and at equilibrium, ΔG° = -RT ln K. Combining these gives ln K = -ΔH°/(RT) + ΔS°/R. This shows how K depends on both ΔH° and ΔS° (system's entropy).

For exothermic reactions (ΔH° negative), increasing T reduces the positive contribution from the -ΔH°/(RT) term, leading to a decrease in K. This is explained by the reduced favorable entropy change in the surroundings (ΔS_surroundings = -ΔH°/T becomes less positive at higher T), which aligns with option D.

For endothermic reactions (ΔH° positive), increasing T makes the negative -ΔH°/(RT) term less significant, and if ΔS° (system) is positive, ln K increases. The surrounding entropy change (ΔS_surroundings = -ΔH°/T) is initially negative (unfavorable), but with higher T, its magnitude decreases, making the reaction more favorable. This matches option B.

Checking the answer choices, options A and C focus on the system's entropy, which doesn't directly explain the temperature effect via surroundings' entropy. Thus, options B and D correctly attribute the changes in K to the entropy of the surroundings, making them the correct answers.
