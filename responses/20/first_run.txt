Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to find the least positive integer \( n \) such that \( \sigma(a^n) - 1 \) is divisible by 2021 for all positive integers \( a \), then find the sum of the prime factors of \( n \).

First, I recall that \( \sigma(a) \) is the sum of divisors of \( a \). For a prime power \( p^k \), \( \sigma(p^k) = 1 + p + p^2 + \dots + p^k \). The problem requires \( \sigma(a^n) \equiv 1 \mod 2021 \) for all \( a \). Since 2021 factors as \( 43 \times 47 \), by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, this must hold modulo 43 and 47 separately.

Considering modulus 43 first, for primes \( p \neq 43 \), \( \sigma(p^{kn}) = \frac{p^{kn+1} - 1}{p - 1} \). For this to be 1 modulo 43, \( p^{kn} \equiv 1 \mod 43 \). The multiplicative group modulo 43 is cyclic of order 42, so \( kn \) must be a multiple of 42. Additionally, if \( p \equiv 1 \mod 43 \), \( \sigma(p^{kn}) = kn + 1 \equiv 1 \mod 43 \), requiring \( kn \equiv 0 \mod 43 \). Thus, \( n \) must be a multiple of both 42 and 43, i.e., \( \text{LCM}(42, 43) = 1806 \).

Similarly, for modulus 47, \( n \) must be a multiple of \( \text{LCM}(46, 47) = 2162 \). Combining both moduli, \( n = \text{LCM}(1806, 2162) \).

Factoring these, 1806 is \( 2 \times 3 \times 7 \times 43 \) and 2162 is \( 2 \times 23 \times 47 \). The LCM is \( 2 \times 3 \times 7 \times 23 \times 43 \times 47 \). The prime factors are 2, 3, 7, 23, 43, 47, and their sum is \( 2 + 3 + 7 + 23 + 43 + 47 = 125 \).
