Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, we have a conveyor belt moving at 20.3 m/s with a maximum power of 15 MW. The hoppers deliver 18 m³/s of a new material, and we need to find the maximum density. 

First, I remember that power (P) is force (F) multiplied by velocity (v). So, P = F × v. Rearranging, F = P / v. Plugging in the numbers, that's 15e6 W / 20.3 m/s ≈ 738,916 N. That force is the frictional force needed to move the material.

But how does density come into play? The volumetric flow rate is 18 m³/s, so the mass flow rate is density (ρ) × 18. The friction force depends on the weight of the material, which is mass × gravity. The total mass on the belt depends on how much material is there at any time. 

Since the belt moves at 20.3 m/s, the material on the belt is spread out. The cross-sectional area (A) can be found by volumetric flow rate divided by velocity: A = 18 / 20.3 ≈ 0.887 m². Then, the mass per unit length is ρ × A.

The frictional force F is μ × (mass per unit length) × g × length of the belt. But without knowing the belt's length, maybe there's another way. Wait, power can also be calculated using the kinetic energy approach. If the material is accelerated from rest to belt speed, the power is (1/2) × mass flow rate × v². But there's a conflict between force-based and energy-based methods here.

Alternatively, considering momentum transfer: force F = mass flow rate × v, which is ρ × 18 × 20.3. Then power P = F × v = ρ × 18 × 20.3². Solving for ρ gives ρ = P / (18 × 20.3²) ≈ 15e6 / (18 × 412.09) ≈ 2023 kg/m³. This seems plausible and matches the units. Since the problem doesn't mention μ, it's likely the answer relies on this momentum transfer approach.
