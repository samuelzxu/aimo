Okay, let's figure out which parts of the reasoning are essential to keep for future steps. 

First, the key points are the molar ratios of the gases, the density relationship leading to molar masses, and the balanced chemical equations. The user considers Avogadro's Law, the ratio of reactants, and the stoichiometry needed to form H2O and HCl. Critical steps include identifying the gases A and B as possibly H2 and Cl2, relating their molar masses via the density ratio, and the resulting mass calculations for the products.

Important sections are:
1. The volume ratios and mole ratios conversion using Avogadro's Law.
2. Determining the molar masses from the density ratio.
3. The stoichiometric calculations for the reactions forming H2O and HCl.
4. The trial-and-error process in identifying the correct gases and their molar masses.
5. The conclusion linking the typical HCl concentration to the answer choice.
