Okay, I need to find the minimum possible value of \(a_1 + a_2\) for the sequence defined by \(a_{n + 2} = \frac{a_n + 2009}{1 + a_{n + 1}}\) where all terms are positive integers. Let's break down the steps.

First, the recurrence relation requires that \(1 + a_{n + 1}\) divides \(a_n + 2009\) for all \(n\). This means each subsequent term must be an integer, so the divisibility condition is crucial.

Considering a possible periodic sequence with period 2, we assume \(a_1 = a_3 = a_5 = \ldots\) and \(a_2 = a_4 = a_6 = \ldots\). Setting up the equations for this scenario:
1. \(a_1 = \frac{a_1 + 2009}{1 + a_2}\)
2. \(a_2 = \frac{a_2 + 2009}{1 + a_1}\)

Solving these equations leads to the condition \(a_1 \cdot a_2 = 2009\). The factors of 2009 are 1, 7, 49, 41, 287, 2009. The pair (49, 41) gives the smallest sum \(49 + 41 = 90\).

Verifying this pair in the recurrence:
- \(a_3 = \frac{49 + 2009}{1 + 41} = \frac{2058}{42} = 49\)
- \(a_4 = \frac{41 + 2009}{1 + 49} = \frac{2050}{50} = 41\)

The sequence continues periodically with these values, confirming that \(a_1 = 49\) and \(a_2 = 41\) work. Testing other potential pairs with smaller sums leads to non-integer terms or larger sums, reinforcing that 90 is indeed the minimum.

Thus, the minimum possible value of \(a_1 + a_2\) is \(\boxed{90}\).
