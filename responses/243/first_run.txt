Okay, let's start breaking down the problem. We have an infinite grid where each unit square has a natural number. Admissible polygons of area n > 2 have equal values (sums) if they're congruent. We need to prove all numbers must be equal.

First, congruent polygons include translations, rotations, reflections. If two polygons can be overlapped via these transformations, their sums must be the same. Suppose there's a difference in numbers somewhere; how to contradict that?

Consider two adjacent squares with numbers a and b. If we can form two congruent polygons that differ only by these squares, their sums would differ by a - b, forcing a = b. But since polygons must have area >2, we need to design such polygons carefully.

For example, take a 1x3 horizontal strip covering a, b, c. Translate it right by one to cover b, c, d. Their sums must be equal, so a = d. Repeating this, the row becomes periodic. But periodicity might not lead to equality unless combined with other transformations.

Next, consider vertical strips. If horizontal and vertical 1x3 strips must have equal sums, this forces row and column periodicities. Overlapping different orientations (like L-shapes) can create equations linking rows and columns, eventually requiring all numbers to be the same.

Another approach: use 2x2 squares. Their sums must be equal wherever they are. Shifting 2x2 squares horizontally or vertically creates equations that force adjacent squares to equal each other. Combining equations from different directions leads to all numbers being equal.

Key steps:
1. Use translation to show periodicity in rows and columns.
2. Use rotation/reflection to equate different orientations, linking rows and columns.
3. Overlap congruent polygons to isolate differences, forcing equality.

Final conclusion: The only way all congruent polygons of area n >2 have equal sums is if every unit square has the same number.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 3: <keep>Prove that if the values of any two congruent admissible polygons are equal, then all the numbers written in the unit squares of the grid are equal.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 2: <keep>Since the problem mentions that even a symmetric image (which would be a reflection) is congruent, so all these transformations don't change the sum of the numbers inside the polygon.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 5: <keep>If that's the case, then maybe the numbers must be the same everywhere, because if they weren't, we could construct two congruent polygons that include different numbers, leading to different sums.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 4: <keep>Suppose we have two squares with numbers a and b. Let me try to construct two congruent polygons that each contain one of these squares, such that the only difference between the polygons is their position (and maybe rotation/reflection), which would force their sums to be equal, hence a = b.</keep>
