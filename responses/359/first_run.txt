Alright, let's break down this problem step by step. We have a right circular cone that's 12 inches tall with a base radius of 5 inches. When the cone is held point down (vertex down), the liquid inside is 9 inches deep. We need to find the height of the liquid when the cone is held point up, expressed in the form \( m - n\sqrt[3]{p} \), and then determine \( m + n + p \).

First, when the cone is held point down, the liquid forms a smaller cone with a height of 9 inches. Using similar triangles, the radius of this smaller cone is proportional to its height. The original cone has a height of 12 and radius 5, so the radius of the liquid's surface is \( \frac{5}{12} \times 9 = 3.75 \) inches. The volume of this smaller cone is calculated as:
\[
V_{\text{liquid}} = \frac{1}{3} \pi (3.75)^2 \times 9
\]
Using the ratio of volumes for similar cones, which is the cube of the ratio of their heights, we get:
\[
\frac{V_{\text{liquid}}}{V_{\text{original}}} = \left( \frac{9}{12} \right)^3 = \left( \frac{3}{4} \right)^3 = \frac{27}{64}
\]
The original volume of the cone is:
\[
V_{\text{original}} = \frac{1}{3} \pi (5)^2 \times 12 = 100\pi
\]
Thus, the volume of the liquid is:
\[
V_{\text{liquid}} = \frac{27}{64} \times 100\pi = \frac{675}{16}\pi
\]

When the cone is inverted, the liquid volume remains the same, but it now occupies the part of the cone not filled by air. Let \( h \) be the height of the air cone at the top. The volume of the air cone is:
\[
V_{\text{air}} = \frac{1}{3} \pi \left( \frac{5}{12}h \right)^2 h = \frac{25}{432}\pi h^3
\]
Setting the air volume equal to the original volume minus the liquid volume:
\[
\frac{25}{432}\pi h^3 = 100\pi - \frac{675}{16}\pi = \frac{925}{16}\pi
\]
Solving for \( h^3 \):
\[
h^3 = \frac{925}{16} \times \frac{432}{25} = 37 \times 27 = 999
\]
Thus,
\[
h = \sqrt[3]{999} = \sqrt[3]{27 \times 37} = 3\sqrt[3]{37}
\]
The height of the liquid is the total height minus the air cone height:
\[
12 - 3\sqrt[3]{37}
\]
Here, \( m = 12 \), \( n = 3 \), and \( p = 37 \). Therefore, \( m + n + p = 12 + 3 + 37 = 52 \).
