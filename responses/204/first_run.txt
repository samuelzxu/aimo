Okay, let me figure out which parts of this reasoning are essential to keep for future steps. The user wants me to mark important tokens with <keep> tags. So the goal is to find the remainder when a_83 = 6^83 +8^83 is divided by 49.

First, the solution uses Euler's theorem since 49 is 7² and φ(49)=42. Both 6 and 8 are coprime with 49, so 6^42 ≡1 mod49 and 8^42≡1 mod49. Since 83 is 42*2 -1, breaking down 6^83 and 8^83 using Euler's theorem to get inverses: 6^83 ≡6^-1 mod49 and 8^83≡8^-1 mod49. Then finding the inverses via the extended Euclidean algorithm gives 6^{-1}=41 and 8^{-1}=43. Adding these gives 84, which mod49 is 35.

Alternatively, using binomial expansion: 6=7-1 and 8=7+1, expanding (7-1)^n and (7+1)^n modulo49, leading to 14n when n is odd. For n=83, 14*83 mod49=35.

Both methods confirm the answer is 35. The key steps here are applying Euler's theorem to reduce exponents, calculating inverses with the extended Euclidean algorithm, and verifying with binomial expansion. These critical points must be retained for future reasoning steps.

Looking through the original reasoning, here are the key sentences and where to apply <keep> tags:

- The application of Euler's theorem to break down the exponents, specifically φ(49)=42 and the coprimality check.
- The decomposition of 83 into 42*2 -1, allowing the use of inverses.
- The calculation of inverses for 6 and 8 mod49 using the extended Euclidean algorithm.
- The verification steps confirming the inverses and the final sum.
- The alternative binomial approach for validation.

I need to mark these parts to retain the essential calculations and theorem applications without including all the derivations.
