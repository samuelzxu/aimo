Okay, so I need to figure out which parts of the existing reasoning trace are essential to keep for future steps. Let me start by understanding the problem and the provided thinking process. The user is asking for eigenvalues and multiplicities of the Laplace operator on an n-dimensional sphere of radius R. The detailed reasoning covers how the eigenvalues scale with radius, generalizes from lower dimensions, calculates multiplicities using binomial coefficients, and verifies with specific examples.

First, the key points here are the derived formulas for eigenvalues and multiplicities. The eigenvalue formula involves k, n, and R, and the multiplicity is expressed in terms of binomial coefficients. These formulas are the end results, so they definitely need to be retained. But also, some intermediate steps might be important for justifying these results if further reasoning is needed.

Looking at the thought process, the initial sections explore recalling properties of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, scaling with radius, and the relation to spherical harmonics. These parts establish the foundation but might not all be necessary once the final formulas are derived. However, the sections where the user derives the scaling factor (1/R²) and connects eigenvalues to harmonic polynomials are crucial.

The critical points to keep are:
1. The scaling of eigenvalues due to radius R.
2. The general form of eigenvalues for the unit sphere and adjusted for radius.
3. The multiplicity formula involving binomial coefficients, including its verification with examples (like n=3 and n=2), which confirms the formula's correctness.

Specific paragraphs and sentences that contain these key points need to be tagged. For example:
- The conclusion that eigenvalues scale by 1/R² is essential.
- The derivation of the eigenvalue formula for the unit sphere and then scaling.
- The discussion on harmonic polynomials and how their dimensions give multiplicities.
- The verification steps with n=3 and n=2 to confirm the multiplicity formula.

Each of these elements supports the final answer and would be necessary if the reasoning were to be continued or verified. They also address potential points of confusion, such as scaling with radius and the correctness of the multiplicity formula across different dimensions.

Now, I need to go through each paragraph and identify the exact sentences or phrases that encapsulate these essential points. For example, in the scaling section: "If we rescale the metric by a factor, say h = c² g, then the Laplace-Beltrami operator with respect to h is Δ_h = (1/c²) Δ_g. Therefore, the eigenvalues of Δ_h are (1/c²) times the eigenvalues of Δ_g." This explains the scaling, so it's important.

Similarly, the formula for multiplicity using binomial coefficients and the example checks (like n=3 yielding 2k+1) are critical validations that should be retained.

I also need to ensure that the kept text blocks are complete sentences or phrases and exactly match the original. Over-tagging should be avoided, but sufficient context must remain to support future reasoning steps.

By marking these sections, the retained tokens will allow future steps to recall how the formulas were derived, confirm their validity, and apply them correctly without rederiving everything from scratch.
