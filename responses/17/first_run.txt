Okay, let me start by breaking down the problem. We need to find the magnitude of the integral I, which involves the magnetic field of a proton dipole and the electron's wavefunction in a hydrogen atom's ground state.

First, the magnetic dipole field formula is recalled, which includes a term that's negligible except at the origin (the delta function term). Since the wavefunction is non-zero at the origin (r=0), we can't ignore the delta function here.

Next, substituting the given wavefunction into the integral. The probability density |Ψ(r)|² is spherically symmetric, so when integrating the dipole field (excluding the delta term) over all space, the angular components cancel out due to symmetry, leaving only the delta function contribution.

The delta function term simplifies the integral significantly. Evaluating at r=0 gives |Ψ(0)|² = 1/(πa₀³). Multiplying by the delta function's coefficient (2μ₀/3)μ_p gives the final expression for I.

Calculating numerically, substituting μ₀, μ_p, and a₀ values, carefully handling units and exponents to arrive at the magnitude of I. The key steps are ensuring the angular integral vanishes and correctly applying the delta function contribution.

After precise calculations, the result is approximately 2.54×10⁻² T, which is boxed as the final answer.
