Okay, let's break down the problem. We need to find the largest proper subset A of X that's closed under the operations ∨ (join) and ∧ (meet). X consists of n-tuples where each component a_k ranges from 0 to k. The key is to identify a subset that's as large as possible but not equal to X itself.

First, the size of X is (n+1)! because each component k has k+1 choices. For example, when n=2, X has 2*3=6 elements. The goal is to find a subset A that's closed under join and meet but is as large as possible.

The initial thought is to consider sublattices. In lattice theory, a sublattice must be closed under these operations. A common approach is to restrict one coordinate. For instance, fixing a coordinate to a certain value or restricting its maximum.

If we fix the nth coordinate to not reach its maximum value n, we reduce its choices from n+1 to n. This restriction affects the total product minimally compared to other coordinates. For example, in n=2, restricting the second coordinate to 0 or 1 gives a sublattice of size 2*2=4, which is larger than fixing the first coordinate.

Extending this to general n, restricting the nth coordinate to 0,1,…,n-1 reduces the product by a factor of n/(n+1). The resulting size is (n+1)! * (n/(n+1)) = n! * n. This sublattice remains closed under join and meet because operations on restricted coordinates stay within the bounds.

Checking for n=2 and n=3 confirms this approach. For n=2, the size is 4 (instead of 6), and for n=3, it's 18 (instead of 24). Other methods, like fixing different coordinates or removing elements, either result in smaller subsets or fail closure properties.

Thus, the largest proper sublattice A is achieved by restricting the nth coordinate, leading to the final answer of n × n!.
