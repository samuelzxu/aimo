Okay, so I need to figure out which parts of the reasoning are essential for future steps. Let's go through each paragraph and see which sentences or phrases contain key points that must be kept.

1. The problem setup: Defines K, Ω, and the requirement for H. Important to keep the exact conditions.
   - "closed subset K inside the closed unit ball... family of chords Ω... dense subset H... any chord connecting two points of H is disjoint from K." Need to keep this to remember the goal.

2. Initial thoughts on using Baire category theorem or Zorn's lemma. Mentions Ω's density and openness. The mention of Baire category is crucial for later steps.
   - "Baire category theorem application... Ω consists of chords lying in the complement of K... K is closed, complement is open." Important for later topological arguments.

3. Considering the space of chords as a manifold and Ω's properties. Key realization about openness.
   - "set of chords disjoint from K is open... Ω is dense in the space of chords." This leads to using open sets in the Baire argument.

4. Connecting to Kuratowski-Ulam theorem. Though the initial approach didn't work, the idea of sections being comeager is a stepping stone.
   - "set Ω is comeager... Kuratowski-Ulam theorem... comeager sets in product space." Highlights the method tried, even if adjusted later.

5. Inductive construction using Baire Category Theorem. This is the core of the solution.
   - "construct H inductively... each step choosing points such that chords avoid K... intersection of dense open sets." The detailed construction steps are essential for understanding the proof.

6. Key steps in the induction: Using a countable basis, ensuring each new point avoids K with all previous points.
   - "countable basis {U_n}... inductively build H... set of x ∈ U_n such that xh_i avoids K is dense open." Explains the mechanics of the induction.

7. Verification using Baire Category Theorem: Intersection of dense open sets is non-empty.
   - "finite intersection of open dense sets is dense... choose h_{k+1} as such a point." Confirms the validity of the construction.

8. Conclusion of the induction process leading to H being dense and satisfying the conditions.
   - "countable set H... intersects every U_n... all chords in Ω." Summarizes the successful construction.

Each of these points contributes to the logical flow, especially the inductive construction using Baire Category Theorem, which is the crux of the proof. The specific mentions of topological properties (open, dense, comeager) and the step-by-step building of H are vital for future reasoning steps.
