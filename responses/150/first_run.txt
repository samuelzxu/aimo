Okay, let's go through the provided reasoning step by step to identify which tokens are essential for future reasoning steps.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The user is asking about time dilation in Carla's frame (CIRF). The key elements are Carla's stopwatch time τ and what Clock B measures. The assistant correctly identifies that time dilation applies here since Clock B is moving relative to Carla.

2. **Recalling Time Dilation**: The reasoning correctly brings up the time dilation formula Δt = γΔτ and clarifies that Δτ is the proper time (in the moving frame). The crucial point here is distinguishing between proper time and coordinate time.

3. **Clarifying Frames**: The assistant debates whether τ is Carla's proper time or coordinate time. This distinction is critical because proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the clock. Since Carla is in her inertial frame, her stopwatch measures proper time.

4. **Determining Clock B's Measurement**: The assistant concludes that Clock B's proper time would be τ divided by γ (or τ multiplied by the Lorentz factor's inverse). This conclusion stems from the correct application of time dilation where moving clocks run slower.

5. **Mathematical Derivation**: The derivation using the spacetime interval formula confirms the result. The assistant calculates Δτ_B = τ * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), solidifying the answer. This step is essential as it provides the mathematical proof of the time dilation effect.

6. **Final Answer Synthesis**: The assistant ensures the answer is in terms of given variables (τ, v, c) since specific values aren't provided. The boxed answer correctly represents the result using LaTeX.

**Essential Tokens Identification**:
- The key points are the relationship between proper and coordinate times, the application of the Lorentz factor, and the final formula derived. These elements are necessary for any subsequent reasoning or problem-solving steps.
