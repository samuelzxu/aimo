Alright, let's break down the thought process and identify which tokens are essential for future reasoning steps.

First, the problem involves applying a C-NOT gate with a control qubit conditioned on |0⟩. The input state is given, and the goal is to determine the output. The reasoning starts by recalling how a standard C-NOT gate works and adjusts for the |0⟩ condition. Key steps include understanding the control and target qubits, applying the gate to each term in the input state, and verifying against answer choices.

Critical tokens to retain include:

1. The adjustment from standard C-NOT (control on |1⟩) to the given condition (control on |0⟩), as this defines the gate's behavior.
2. Breaking down the input state into components and how each component transforms under the gate. Specifically, the transformation when the control is |0⟩ versus |1⟩.
3. The conclusion that the first term (α|0⟩⊗|0⟩) becomes α|0⟩⊗|1⟩ and the other terms remain unchanged.
4. The comparison with answer choices, highlighting why option C matches the derived result.

These points ensure that future steps can verify the reasoning, check transformations, and confirm the correct answer.

Here are the essential tokens to retain for future reasoning steps, marked with <keep> tags:

- Paragraph 1, Sentence 2: <keep>the condition is that the first qubit of control has to be in the state \left|0\right\rangle.</keep>

- Paragraph 1, Sentence 3: <keep>the input is given as |ψ⟩ = (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩) ⊗ |0⟩</keep>

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 2: <keep>the C-NOT will apply an X gate (i.e., flip the target qubit) only if the control qubit is |0⟩</keep>

- Paragraph 3, Sentences 1-2: <keep>input state, the target qubit is |0⟩. So, for the terms where the first qubit is |0⟩, we flip the second qubit.</keep>

- Paragraph 3, Bullet 1: <keep>α|0⟩⊗|0⟩ → ... becomes |0⟩⊗X|0⟩ = |0⟩⊗|1⟩</keep>

- Paragraph 3, Bullet 2-3: <keep>β|1⟩⊗|0⟩ → ... stays as |1⟩⊗|0⟩ ... -γ|1⟩⊗|0⟩ → ... target stays |0⟩</keep>

- Paragraph 4, Sentence 2: <keep>output should be α|0⟩⊗|1⟩ + β|1⟩⊗|0⟩ - γ|1⟩⊗|0⟩</keep>

- Paragraph 5, Sentence 3: <keep>Option C: α|0⟩⊗|1⟩ + (β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩)⊗|0⟩. Yes, this matches my calculation</keep>

- Paragraph 7, Sentence 1: <keep>Original input is |ψ⟩ = (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩) ⊗ |0⟩</keep>

- Paragraph 7, Bullet 1-2: <keep>α|0⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ → becomes |0⟩⊗|1⟩ ... (β - γ)|1⟩ ⊗ |0⟩ → stays |1⟩⊗|0⟩</keep>

- Paragraph 9, Sentence 3: <keep>answer is option C</keep>

These selections ensure the critical logic about the gate's behavior, state decomposition, and comparison with answer choices is retained.
