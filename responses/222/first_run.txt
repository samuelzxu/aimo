Okay, I need to figure out which tokens to keep for future reasoning steps. Let me start by going through the problem and the existing reasoning.

The problem has two parts: part a) asks for a polynomial P(x) such that b_n = P(a_n/n), and part b) requires proving the existence of a sequence {n_k} such that the limit of b_{n_k} is 2024/2025.

Looking at the trajectory, the key steps are:

1. Understanding the definition of a_n. The sequence a_n is defined using floor(-log_4 n), leading to intervals where a_n is constant. This analysis determines how a_n behaves in different ranges of n, which is crucial for calculating the sum.

2. Calculating the sum S_n = sum_{k=1}^n a_k. The detailed breakdown of the sum into intervals where a_n is constant (e.g., 4, 16, 64) is essential. The formula derived for S_n in terms of intervals and how it contributes to b_n is important.

3. Expressing b_n in terms of a_n/n. Here, the polynomial P(x) is found to be x - (1/5)x^2. This derivation is critical for part a).

4. For part b), solving the quadratic equation to find the roots and showing that by choosing n_k appropriately (near 4^M/t for the root t), the limit can be achieved. The discussion on constructing n_k in specific intervals and the continuity argument are vital.

The key parts to retain are the intervals where a_n is constant, the formula for S_n, the derivation of P(x), the quadratic equation solving for the limit, and the construction of n_k. These elements are essential for future reasoning steps because they contain the definitions, derived formulas, and the logic needed to establish both parts a) and b).
