To determine the number of lattice points on the hyperbola \( x^2 - y^2 = 2000^2 \), we start by factoring the equation into \((x - y)(x + y) = 2000^2\). Here, \(2000^2 = 2^8 \cdot 5^6\). Both factors \((x - y)\) and \((x + y)\) must be even integers, leading us to consider pairs of even divisors of \(2000^2\).

1. **Prime Factorization and Even Divisors**:
   - The prime factorization of \(2000\) is \(2^4 \cdot 5^3\), so \(2000^2 = 2^8 \cdot 5^6\).
   - We need pairs of even divisors \((a, b)\) such that \(a \leq b\) and \(a \cdot b = 2000^2\). Each even divisor must include at least one factor of 2.

2. **Factor Pairs**:
   - By factoring out 2 from both \(a\) and \(b\), we reduce the problem to finding pairs \((a', b')\) such that \(a' \cdot b' = 2^6 \cdot 5^6\).
   - The number of divisors of \(2^6 \cdot 5^6\) is \((6+1)(6+1) = 49\), leading to 25 unordered pairs (since it is a perfect square).

3. **Generating Solutions**:
   - Each pair \((a, b)\) corresponds to \(x = \frac{a + b}{2}\) and \(y = \frac{b - a}{2}\). Each valid pair \((a, b)\) results in integer solutions for \(x\) and \(y\).
   - For each solution \((x, y)\) in the first quadrant, we also consider points in all four quadrants: \((\pm x, \pm y)\).

4. **Symmetry and Axial Points**:
   - The hyperbola is symmetric about both axes and the origin. Each solution \((x, y)\) in the first quadrant contributes four points unless \(y = 0\).
   - The points \((2000, 0)\) and \((-2000, 0)\) on the x-axis are counted separately.

5. **Counting Solutions**:
   - There are 24 pairs where \(a \neq b\), each contributing four points.
   - The pair \((2000, 2000)\) contributes two points on the x-axis.

Summarizing, the total number of lattice points is \(24 \times 4 + 2 = 98\).
