Here is the step-by-step explanation and key elements of the reasoning process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to prove that the set \( A = \{ h \in [0,1] : f(x+h) = f(x) \text{ for some } x \in [0,1] \} \) is Lebesgue measurable and has measure at least \( \frac{1}{2} \).
   - The function \( f \) is continuous on \([0,1]\) with \( f(0) = f(1) = 0 \).

2. **Measurability of \( A \)**:
   - The set \( E = \{ (x, h) \in [0,1]^2 : x + h \leq 1, f(x+h) = f(x) \} \) is closed (as the preimage of \( 0 \) under the continuous function \( g(x,h) = f(x+h) - f(x) \)).
   - Projection of closed sets in \( \mathbb{R}^2 \) onto one axis (here, the \( h \)-axis) results in analytic sets, which are universally measurable. Thus, \( A \) is Lebesgue measurable.

3. **Lower Bound on Measure**:
   - Define \( E_h = \{ x \in [0,1-h] : f(x+h) = f(x) \} \). By Fubini’s theorem, the measure of \( E \) is \( \int_0^1 m(E_h) \, dh \), where \( m(E_h) \) is the measure of \( E_h \).
   - Consider the integral \( \int_0^1 \int_0^{1-h} (f(x+h) - f(x))^2 \, dx \, dh \). Using substitutions and Fubini’s theorem, this integral equals \( \frac{1}{2} \int_0^1 \int_0^1 (f(y) - f(x))^2 \, dy \, dx \), which simplifies to \( ||f||_2^2 - \left( \int_0^1 f(x) \, dx \right)^2 \).

4. **Application of Intermediate Value Theorem**:
   - For each \( h \in [0,1] \), define \( H(x) = f(x+h) - f(x) \). By continuity, if \( H(x) \) changes sign or equals zero over \( x \in [0,1-h] \), there exists \( x \) such that \( H(x) = 0 \), implying \( h \in A \).

5. **Symmetry and Measure Analysis**:
   - Consider pairs \( (h, 1-h) \). If \( f(h) \cdot f(1-h) \leq 0 \), the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees \( h \in A \).
   - Define \( B = \{ h \in [0,1] : f(h) \cdot f(1-h) \geq 0 \} \). The complement of \( B \) (where \( f(h) \cdot f(1-h) < 0 \)) must have measure at least \( \frac{1}{2} \), ensuring \( A \) has measure at least \( \frac{1}{2} \).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The set \( A \) is measurable due to its construction via projection. The measure argument leverages the properties of continuous functions and symmetry, ensuring \( A \) occupies at least half the interval \([0,1]\).
