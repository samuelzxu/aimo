Alright, let's break down how I approached identifying the essential tokens for future reasoning steps in this problem.

First, I read through the entire reasoning trace provided. The problem involves calculating the expected number of days Emilia needs to convert six saplings into trees, each with a 1/2 probability daily. The key steps involve understanding the geometric distribution of each sapling's conversion time and the maximum of these variables.

The critical parts of the reasoning include:
1. **Modeling the problem as the maximum of six geometric distributions**: Each sapling's conversion time is a geometric random variable with p=1/2.
2. **Using expectation formula for the maximum of independent variables**: The formula E[T] = sum_{k=1}^∞ P(T ≥ k) was applied here.
3. **Applying inclusion-exclusion principle**: To handle the probability that all six saplings are converted by a certain day.
4. **Detailed calculations for each term in the inclusion-exclusion sum**: Breaking down each term's contribution to the final expectation.

I needed to identify which parts of the explanation are crucial for future steps. The key equations and transitions, such as the expectation formula, inclusion-exclusion expansion, and the step-by-step calculation of each term, are essential. These parts ensure that any subsequent verification or continuation of the reasoning can follow the logical flow without rederiving foundational concepts.

For instance, the derivation of the expectation using the inclusion-exclusion principle and the computation of each binomial term's contribution (like k=1 to k=6) are pivotal. Without these steps, the final fraction 7880/1953 wouldn't be justified, and thus the final answer would be unsubstantiated.

Moreover, verifying the coprimality of m and n (7880 and 1953) through the GCD calculation ensures the fraction is in simplest form. This step is crucial for the problem's answer format, which specifies m and n must be coprime.

Hence, the essential tokens include the formulation of expectation, inclusion-exclusion steps, term-by-term calculations, and the final simplification to 7880/1953, along with the GCD verification. These elements collectively support the final answer and must be retained for clarity and correctness.
