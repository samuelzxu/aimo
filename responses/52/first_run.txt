Okay, let's go through the problem step by step. The user needs the smallest yummy integer A, which is part of a consecutive sequence summing to 2014. 

First, I recall that the sum of k consecutive integers starting from n is given by k*n + k*(k-1)/2 = 2014. Multiplying both sides by 2 gives 2kn + k(k-1) = 4028. This factors to k*(2n + k - 1) = 4028.

Next, I factorize 4028 to find all divisors, which are 1, 2, 4, 19, 38, 53, 76, 106, 212, 1007, 2014, 4028. For each divisor k, calculate n = (4028/k - k + 1)/2 and check if it's integer.

Key steps include:

1. For k=4028, n = (1 - 4028 + 1)/2 = -2013, leading to a sequence from -2013 to 2014.
2. This sequence sums correctly because the average is 0.5, and 0.5 * 4028 = 2014.
3. Other k values like 1007 give n=-501, 212 gives n=-96, but -2013 is the smallest.

Verifying each critical divisor and calculation ensures correctness. Thus, the minimal yummy integer is -2013.

- Paragraph 4, Sentence 2: <keep>An integer A is yummy if there's a consecutive sequence of integers (could be any length, right? At least 1, but including A itself) that sums up to 2014.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 3: <keep>But since we need the smallest yummy integer, it's going to be less than 2014.</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 2: <keep>If a sequence of consecutive integers adds up to a certain number, there's a formula for the sum of consecutive numbers.</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 3: <keep>If you have a sequence starting at a and ending at b, the sum is (b - a + 1)*(a + b)/2.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 1: <keep>Let's say we have k consecutive integers starting from n.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 2: <keep>Then their sum would be k*n + (k*(k-1))/2.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 4: <keep>k*n + k*(k-1)/2 = 2014.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 1: <keep>Multiply both sides by 2: 2kn + k(k - 1) = 4028</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 2: <keep>Then, k*(2n + k -1) = 4028</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 3: <keep>So, this equation tells me that k must be a divisor of 4028.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 1: <keep>First, factorizing 4028. Let's find all the divisors of 4028.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 4: <keep>Therefore, the prime factors are 2, 2, 19, 53.</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, all divisors of 4028 are: 1, 2, 4, 19, 38, 53, 76, 106, 212, 1007, 2014, 4028.</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 1: <keep>For each k in this list, we can compute n as: n = (4028/k - k + 1)/2.</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 2: <keep>Note that if n is integer, then this represents a valid starting number n.</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 1: <keep>k=1. n = (4028/1 -1 +1)/2 = 2014.</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 4: <keep>k=4. n=(4028/4 -4 +1)/2 = 502.</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 7: <keep>k=19. n=(4028/19 -19 +1)/2= 97.</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 9: <keep>k=53. n=(4028/53 -53 +1)/2=12.</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 11: <keep>k=76. n=(4028/76 -76 +1)/2= -11.</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 13: <keep>k=212. n=(4028/212 -212 +1)/2= -96.</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 15: <keep>k=1007. n=(4028/1007 -1007 +1)/2=-501.</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 17: <keep>k=4028. n=(4028/4028 -4028 +1)/2= -2013.</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentence 1: <keep>Among these, the minimal n is -2013.</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentence 3: <keep>The sum from -2013 to 2014 inclusive.</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentence 4: <keep>The average is (-2013 +2014 )/2=0.5, times 4028 terms gives 0.5*4028=2014.</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentence 5: <keep>Therefore, that's a correct sum.</keep>
- Paragraph 14, Sentence 1: <keep>The minimal possible integer A is the minimal member among all possible sequences, which is indeed the minimal starting term in each allowed k.</keep>
- Paragraph 14, Sentence 2: <keep>Given that each sequence's minimal term is n, calculated as for each k.</keep>
- Paragraph 14, Sentence 3: <keep>Therefore, overall minimal n is -2013.</keep>
- Paragraph 15, Sentence 1: <keep>Verifying each critical divisor and calculation ensures correctness.</keep>
- Paragraph 15, Sentence 2: <keep>Thus, the minimal yummy integer is -2013.</keep>
- Paragraph 16, Sentence 1: <keep>Final Answer: \boxed{-2013}</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 4: <keep>Therefore, the expression (4028/k - k + 1) is divisible by 2.</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 3: <keep>If n is integer, then such a sequence exists.</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 1: <keep>The problem with that is that this includes all integers from -2013 through 2014.</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 2: <keep>However, the sum from -a to a is 0.</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 4: <keep>sum from n=-2013 to 0: this is sum_{k=1}^{2013} (-k) +0= - (2013)(2014)/2.</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 5: <keep>sum from 1 to 2014: (2014)(2015)/2.</keep>
