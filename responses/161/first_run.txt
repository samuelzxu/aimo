Okay, I need to figure out which tokens are essential for future reasoning steps in solving the problem about the intersection of plane PQR with a cube. Let me go through the provided thought process step by step.

1. **Understanding the Cube and Points**:
   - The cube has edges AB, BC, CD, each of length 20.
   - Points P, Q, R are on these edges with given distances: AP=5, BQ=15, CR=10.
   - Coordinates assigned: P(5,0,0), Q(20,15,0), R(20,20,10).
   
   **Essential Tokens**: Coordinates of P, Q, R and edge lengths are crucial for determining the plane equation and intersection points.

2. **Finding the Plane Equation**:
   - Vectors PQ and PR calculated.
   - Cross product gives the normal vector (150, -150, 75).
   - Plane equation derived as 2x - 2y + z = 10.
   
   **Essential Tokens**: The plane equation is fundamental for finding intersections with cube edges.

3. **Identifying Intersection Points**:
   - Checking each cube edge against the plane equation.
   - Intersection points found: P, Q, R, (0,0,10), (15,20,20), (0,5,20).
   
   **Essential Tokens**: The six intersection points determine the polygon's vertices, necessary for area calculation.

4. **Calculating the Area**:
   - Ordering the points and applying the formula for a planar polygon in 3D.
   - Cross products summed and magnitude calculated, resulting in area 525.
   
   **Essential Tokens**: The ordered points and the method to calculate the area using cross products are key steps.

**Conclusion**: The key elements are the coordinates of the points, the plane equation, the intersection points, and the method for area calculation. These parts must be retained for future reasoning.
