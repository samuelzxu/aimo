Okay, so I have this geometry problem here involving a cube. Three edges are given: AB, BC, and CD, and AD is an interior diagonal. Points P, Q, R are on AB, BC, and CD respectively. The lengths are AP = 5, PB = 15; BQ = 15, and CR = 10. The question is asking for the area of the polygon formed by the intersection of plane PQR and the cube. Hmm, okay.

First, let me visualize the cube. I know that in a cube, all edges are equal, but here they mention edges AB, BC, CD, which are consecutive edges, forming a path from A to B to C to D. Then AD is an interior diagonal. Wait, AD is connecting two vertices that are not adjacent, so that diagonal would pass through the interior of the cube.

The cube edges: Let me check. In a standard cube, each vertex is connected to three others. If AB, BC, CD are edges, then A, B, C, D are part of the cube. Since AD is an interior diagonal, vertices A and D must be opposite each other through the cube's interior. That makes sense. So, if I imagine the cube, A is connected to B, B to C, C to D, and then AD is the space diagonal.

So in the cube, each edge must have the same length. Wait, AP = 5, PB =15. So AB must be 20. Then, considering AB, BC, CD are edges of the cube, so each edge should be 20 units? Wait, isn't that inconsistent because CR is given as 10? CD is an edge, right? So CR + RD = CD. If CR = 10, then RD should be 10 as well if CD is 20. Wait, but that is not specified. Let me check.

Wait, AP = 5, PB =15. So AB = AP + PB = 5 +15=20. Similarly, BQ=15, but BC is another edge, so BC should be equal to AB, which is 20. Therefore, QC would be BC - BQ=20 -15=5. Similarly, CD is another edge of the cube, meaning CD=20, hence CR=10 implies RD=20 -10=10.

Okay, so each edge of the cube is 20 units long because the edges AB, BC, etc., are 20. So CR is 10, which is half of CD. Wait, if CD is 20, then CR=10 is halfway from C to D? No, CR=10 is half of CD? Wait, because CD=20, so CR=10 is halfway.

Therefore, the cube has edges of length 20. The points P, Q, R are along AB, BC, CD respectively: AP=5, BQ=15, CR=10. Then, plane PQR intersects the cube, forming a polygon. We need to compute the area of this polygon.

First, to find the intersection polygon, I need to figure out where the plane cuts the cube edges. To do that, maybe setting up coordinates would help.

Let me assign coordinates to the cube vertices. Let's take vertex A at the origin (0,0,0). Then, moving along AB, which would be along the x-axis. So point B would then be (20,0,0). Then, moving from B to C is along the y-axis, so point C is (20,20,0). Then from C to D, which, since CD is an edge, should be along the z-axis? Wait, but AD is an interior diagonal. Wait, if A is (0,0,0) and D has coordinates (20,20,20), then AD is a space diagonal. Wait, but if BC goes from (20,0,0) to (20,20,0), which is along the y-axis, and then CD is an edge. If C is (20,20,0), then D is (20,20,20), moving along the z-axis? For AD to be from (0,0,0) to (20,20,20), yes. But then, from C (20,20,0) to D (20,20,20) is going up along the z-axis.

Wait, let's confirm the coordinates. Let's set A at (0,0,0). Then, since AB is an edge, let's make AB along the x-axis. So B is (20,0,0). BC is another edge, assuming from B(20,0,0) to point C. If the cube is standard, BC could be along the y-axis, so C would be (20,20,0). Then CD is from C(20,20,0) upward along the z-axis to D(20,20,20). Then AD goes from (0,0,0) to (20,20,20), which is a space diagonal. Got it.

So the cube has edges of length 20. Coordinates:

A (0,0,0)

B (20,0,0)

C (20,20,0)

D (20,20,20)

Let's check if AD is a space diagonal. From (0,0,0) to (20,20,20), yes, that's the space diagonal.

Other vertices:

From A(0,0,0), if moving along y-axis would get to (0,20,0), then z-axis to (0,20,20), but since the cube is determined by edges AB, BC, CD, and AD, we can define all vertices accordingly.

But maybe I don't need all vertices. Probably P, Q, R are points along AB, BC, CD respectively.

So point P is on AB: AP=5, so since AB is from (0,0,0) to (20,0,0), moving along the x-axis. So P is at (5, 0,0).

Point Q is on BC: BQ=15. BC is from (20,0,0) to (20,20,0), along the y-axis. So B is at (20,0,0), moving 15 units along BC which is the y-direction, so Q is at (20,15,0).

Point R is on CD: CR=10. CD is from C(20,20,0) to D(20,20,20), along the z-axis. So CR=10 means moving up from C 10 units, so R is at (20,20,10).

So we have points P(5,0,0), Q(20,15,0), R(20,20,10). Now, we need to find the intersection of the plane PQR with the cube and then calculate its area.

To find the intersection polygon, we need to find all points where the plane cuts the edges of the cube. The intersection of a plane with a cube can be a polygon with up to six sides, depending on the plane's orientation.

So, let's first find the equation of the plane PQR. Once we have the plane equation, we can check where it intersects the cube edges.

To find the plane equation, we can use the coordinates of P, Q, R.

Points:

P: (5,0,0)

Q: (20,15,0)

R: (20,20,10)

First, let me find two vectors on the plane.

Vector PQ = Q - P = (20-5, 15-0, 0-0) = (15,15,0)

Vector PR = R - P = (20-5,20-0,10 -0) = (15,20,10)

Then, the normal vector to the plane will be the cross product of vectors PQ and PR.

Compute normal vector N = PQ Ã— PR.

PQ = (15,15,0)

PR = (15,20,10)

Cross product:

|i    j    k|
|15  15    0|
|15  20   10|

Calculating determinant:

i*(15*10 - 0*20) - j*(15*10 -0*15) + k*(15*20 -15*15)

= i*(150 - 0) - j*(150 - 0) + k*(300 -225)

= (150)i - 150j +75k

So normal vector N is (150, -150, 75)

We can write the plane equation as 150(x - 5) -150(y - 0) +75(z - 0) = 0

Plugging point P(5,0,0) into the equation.

Simplify:

150x - 750 -150y +75z =0

Divide all terms by 75:

2x -10 -2y + z =0

So

2x -2y + z =10

Therefore, the plane equation is 2x -2y + z =10.

Simplify further? Maybe divide by common factors, but 2x -2y + z =10 is manageable.

Alternatively, you can write as 2x -2y + z -10 =0

Now, this is the equation of plane PQR. Next step is to find where this plane intersects the edges of the cube.

The cube has 12 edges. Let's list each edge and check if the plane intersects it.

But before that, note that the intersection points will lie on an edge if the plane equation has a solution passing through that edge. Since we have a convex polyhedron (the cube), the intersection with a plane will be a convex polygon. The polygon's vertices will be the points where the plane intersects the cube edges.

Because a cube has edges aligned along axes, let me parameterize each edge and solve for the intersection.

But this might be time-consuming, but perhaps manageable given the coordinates.

Alternatively, observe the symmetry and parametrize.

Let me consider all edges, check if they cross the plane. Since the cube has edges along x, y, z axes, starting or ending at various points from 0 to 20 (since edge length is 20).

But with the established coordinate system, the vertices can be found as follows.

List of edges in the cube. Each edge connects two vertices. Let's list all edges:

From A(0,0,0):

AB (to B(20,0,0)), AE (to (0,20,0)), which is along y-axis?, actually, maybe not. Wait, no, correct vertices:

Wait, earlier we were considering the cube with edges AB, BC, CD, but also connecting in the z direction. Wait, perhaps confusion arose here.

Wait, maybe I need to identify all the vertices properly. Since vertex D is (20,20,20). So vertices in addition to A,B,C,D.

Wait, if A is (0,0,0), B is (20,0,0), C is (20,20,0). Then D is (20,20,20). Then, so moving up along z-axis.

Also, from A(0,0,0), moving along y-axis to point, let's say E (0,20,0). Then from E(0,20,0) up to EE (0,20,20) (F?). Similarly, similar others.

But since the problem mentions edges AB, BC, CD, and and interior diag AD. So maybe the cube is determined with those four points?

Wait, perhaps my initial coordinate assignment is incomplete.

Alternatively, another way. Since AD is a space diagonal, and the edges AB, BC, CD are consecutive.

We can think of the cube as A(0,0,0), B(1,0,0), C(1,1,0), D(1,1,1). Then AD is the diagonal from (0,0,0) to (1,1,1). But in this problem, all edges have length 20. Hmm, rather different values. But given the edge lengths here (AP=5, PB=15, etc.), edge AB must be 20 units. So it's as if each edge of the cube is of length 20. (Since AB, BC, CD are edges and each is given as AP + PB =5 +15=20, BQ=15, CQ=5, etc., so each edge is 20).

So yes, every edge length is 20.

Given that, let's reorient ourselves.

Coordinates:

A(0,0,0)

B(20,0,0)

C(20,20,0)

D(20,20,20)

E(0,20,0)

F(0,0,20)

But actually, since the problem doesn't mention all the vertices, but mentions AB, BC, CD, AD. So perhaps the cube is oriented such that ABCDA is a path along the "base" face and the space diagonal AD. Then going up from D as part of the upper face.

But regardless, edges:

For completeness, the cube will have 12 edges. From each of the 8 vertices, connections along x, y, z axes.

List of edges:

1. AB: A(0,0,0) to B(20,0,0) (along x-axis)

2. BC: B(20,0,0) to C(20,20,0) (along y-axis)

3. CD: C(20,20,0) to D(20,20,20) (along z-axis)

4. DA: D(20,20,20) to A(0,0,0) (space diagonal, so not an edge but diagonal)

Wait, DA is the space diagonal, which is given as an interior diagonal.

Wait, but in a cube, edges are only the single-direction connections. Then the cube will have edges like:

Front face (z=0): AB, BC, CE, EA.

Wait, I need to correct.

Actually, with A(0,0,0), B(20,0,0), C(20,20,0), D might actually be (20,20,20). Then edges:

Axes-aligned edges from each vertex:

From A(0,0,0):

To B(20,0,0) [x+]

To E(0,20,0) [y+]

To F(0,0,20) [z+]

From B(20,0,0):

To C(20,20,0) [y+]

To G(20,0,20) [z+]

From C(20,20,0):

To D(20,20,20) [z+]

To H(20,20,0)? Wait, already given. Wait, but perhaps my vertex labels are inconsistent here. If D is (20,20,20), does it mean that from C we go up in z to D?

Yes, that seems right.

Then from E(0,20,0):

To C as (20,20,0); Wait, no, E is (0,20,0), so connection from E(0,20,0) to next vertex along x?

Wait, now confusion is creeping in because assigning labels beyond A,B,C,D may be necessary.

Let me instead list all edges as per the standard cube.

In a cube, each vertex is connected to three others. If A is (0,0,0), then adjacent vertices are B(1,0,0), E(0,1,0), and another in z-direction, say(0,0,1). But given that in our problem, the vertices are named as A(0,0,0), B(20,0,0), C(20,20,0), D(20,20,20).

We can get part of the cube.

Therefore, starting from A(0,0,0), edges along x, y, z axes:

- AB: x-axis to (20,0,0)

- AE: y-axis to (0,20,0)

- AF: z-axis to (0,0,20)

From B(20,0,0), adjacent edges:

- BA: back to A

- BC: y-axis to (20,20,0)

- also, BG: z-axis to (20,0,20)

From C(20,20,0), edges:

- CB: back to B

- CD: z-axis to D(20,20,20)

- CK: maybe another edge? To next vertex, but since D is given, likely connected up

From D(20,20,20):

- DC: back to C(20,20,0)

- DK: along some axes, but in proper coordinates.

Wait, but here in this problem, we have AB, BC, CD as edges, and AD is a space diagonal. This suggests:

A connected to B via AB (x-axis)

B connected to C (y-axis)

C connected to D via CD (z-axis)

and A connected to D via space diagonal.

This isn't a standard cube unless different edges are considered. Wait, perhaps the cube is not axis-aligned? No, the problem in three dimensional geometry considers the edges as AB, BC, CD, which are consecutive, meaning A, B, C, D are sequential vertices with each consecutive pair connected by an edge of the cube. So given that the coordinates make AB, BC, CD edges of the cubeâ€”so their coordinate assignments follow.

Thus, perhaps moving along different axes.

Wait another approach. Since the edges AB, BC, and CD are the consecutive edges.

First, let me reconsider the coordinates so that this path ABCDA is a tetrahedron within the cube.

Wait, maybe, but this could get tangled. Let me try to use the initial coordinate system and stay with that.

Given my earlier coordinates:

A(0,0,0)

B(20,0,0)

C(20,20,0)

D(20,20,20)

And connecting the edges AB, BC, CD, and AD is a space diagonal. So okay.

Therefore, the other edges are also present, like BE, AE, AF etc., but since the problem does not mention them, perhaps they are unimportant.

But to find intersections of plane PQR with the cube, we need to see all edges.

So first, let me detail all edges.

From each vertex, three edges (moving in x+, y+, z+ if possible):

At A(0,0,0)=the origin.

Edge AB: A(0,0,0) to B(20,0,0) (x-axis, forward)

Edge AE: A(0,0,0) to E(0,20,0) (y-axis, right)

Edge AF: A(0,0,0) to F(0,0,20) (z-axis, upward)

Similarly, at B(20,0,0):

Edge BA: back to A

Edge BC: to C(20,20,0) (y-axis, forward)

Edge BG: B(20,0,0) to G(20,0,20) (z-axis up)

At C(20,20,0):

Edge CB: back to B

Edge CD: to D(20,20,20) (z-axis up)

Edge CCâ€™?: No, but there might be another edge; actually, from C(20,20,0), the third edge could go to H(0,20,0) perhaps? Wait, no. Waitâ€”in the cube, each vertex is connected to three others. So for example, vertex C (20,20,0):

From C, edges BC (connecting to B(20,0,0)), CD (up to D(20,20,20)), and also another edge in the -x direction or perhaps in the other direction.

But no, in a cube, edges are only positive direction.

Wait maybe C can move along y-axis to (20,20+,0) but that would exit the cube. So actually, from each vertex, you have edges in +x, +y, +z if possible. But since A is at the origin, opposite vertex would be (20,20,20)=D. Therefore, all other vertices have coordinates (0 or 20 in each axis).

Hence, if we're at C(20,20,0), edges to B(20,0,0) (y negative direction), D(20,20,20) (z positive direction), and perhaps (0,20,0)? But that vertex is E, which is actually (0,20,0). But moving from C(20,20,0) to E(0,20,0) would be along the x-axis negative direction. But in our cube, do we need to have that?

Yes, perhaps. Because in a cube, adjacent vertices. The front face (z=0) would have vertices A(0,0,0), B(20,0,0), C(20,20,0), E(0,20,0) forming a square, correct.

So moving from C(20,20,0) to E(0,20,0) along x decreasing direction is an edge.

Therefore, yes, there is an edge CE connecting C(20,20,0) to E(0,20,0). Wait, but CE would be [assuming E of (0,20,0)] that can't beâ€”distance would be 20sqrt(2). Wait, but edge length should be 20. Hmm, since in a cube, adjacent edges are only those differing in one coordinate. So from C(20,20,0), the adjacent vertices would be B(20,0,0), D(20,20,20), and..., yes, if there is a vertex at E(0,20,0), then C(20,20,0) connected via edge to E(0,20,0) would indeed be of length 20 along x-axis, but this would require CE's coordinate to be (0,20,0). But in that case, is A connected to E? If E is (0,20,0), yes, from A(0,0,0) to E(0,20,0) is along y-axis. So that's edge AE. Then front face is square A(0,0,0), B(20,0,0), C(20,20,0), E(0,20,0), forming a square in z=0 plane.

Okay, then edges of the cube:

From A:

- AB (x), AE (y), AF (z)

From B:

- BA (x-), BC (y), BG (z)

From C:

- CB (y-), CD (z), CE (x-)

Wait, connecting to E.

Similarly, from D(20,20,20):

- DC (z-), DG (which?), ... Wait, this is getting complex. Maybe easier to categorize all edges.

Alternatively, since all edges are axis-aligned and each edge is of the form (from, to, axis):

x-axis edges: moving between x and x+20 in x-direction, y and z same.

So for example:

Edge AE is moving from A(0,0,0) to E(0,20,0) along y-axis.

Edge AF is A to (0,0,20) along z-axis.

Similarly, edges connecting B(20,0,0):

Moving along y-axis to C(20,20,0), moving along z-axis to BG(20,0,20)

From C(20,20,0):

Moving along x-axis to E(0,20,0) [Wait, no, along x-axis from C(20,20,0) in negative direction to (0,20,0) is an edge, but that would be (X=20 to X=0, y=20, z=0). So CE.

Then, from D(20,20,20):

Along x-axis negative direction to E(0,20,20)? Hmm.

Wait, but cube edges are three edges per vertex. Let's outline all edges.

Vertex list with coordinates:

1. A(0,0,0)
2. B(20,0,0)
3. C(20,20,0)
4. D(20,20,20)
5. E(0,20,0)
6. F(0,0,20)
7. G(20,0,20)
8. H(0,20,20)

But given that AD is present, but H may or may not be.

Anyway, needn't label all if unnecessary, but since the intersection plane could intersect edges not on the main path ABCDA.

So all edges:

Front face (z=0):

A-B(20,0,0)

B-C(20,20,0)

C-E(0,20,0)

E-A(0,0,0)

Wait, in z=0 plane. Hmmm, Hmmm, noâ€”from C to E is movement left along x-axis? From C(20,20,0) to E(0,20,0).

But in standard cube, edges would be from C to coordinate reduced in x, but connecting C(20,20,0) to E(0,20,0), that would not be a standard edge. Because normally, if C is (20,20,0), moving in -x direction gives (0,20,0) only if that edge is in x-axis.

But in our case, but in reality, E is (0,20,0), so edge AE is along +y from A.

Edge EC is from E(0,20,0) to C(20,20,0) is, but E to C is along +x.

So front face is a square: A(0,0,0) - B(20,0,0) - C(20,20,0) - E(0,20,0) -A. So yes, connected via four edges.

Similarly, in the z=20 plane, the top face is F(0,0,20)-G(20,0,20)-D(20,20,20)-H(0,20,20)-F.

And the vertical edges (along z-axis):

A-F (0,0,0)-(0,0,20)

B-G(20,0,0)-(20,0,20)

C-D(20,20,0)-(20,20,20)

E-H(0,20,0)-(0,20,20)

Hence, 12 edges:

Front face (z=0): AB, BC, CE, EA

Top face (z=20): FG, GD, DH, HF

Vertical edges: AF, BG, CD, EH.

Wait, no, CE is part of front face, no vertical... Wait, actually, in z=0 plane, if E(0,20,0) is connected to C(20,20,0) along x-axis.

Similarly, vertical edges from E(0,20,0) to H(0,20,20), etc.

So with the cube defined with 8 vertices and 12 edges, we can list all edges:

Edges along x-axis:

AB: (0,0,0)-(20,0,0)

BC: (20,0,0)-(20,20,0): Wait, BC is along y-axis. Wait, no:

AB is (0,0,0)-(20,0,0): +x

BC: a(20,0,0)-(20,20,0): +y

CE: (20,20,0)-(0,20,0): -x

EA: (0,20,0)-(0,0,0): -y (+ depends on which order)

But no, wait, actually, BC is from B(20,0,0) to C(20,20,0): along +y axis.

Similarly, CE connects C(20,20,0) to E(0,20,0): along -x axis.

AE connects E(0,20,0) back to A(0,0,0): along -y axis.

Then, the vertical edges (z-axis):

AF: (0,0,0)-(0,0,20)

BG: (20,0,0)-(20,0,20)

CD: (20,20,0)-(20,20,20). Wait, CD is given as C(20,20,0) to D(20,20,20), yes, vertical.

EH: (0,20,0)-(0,20,20)

Then top face edges:

FG: (0,0,20)-(20,0,20)

GH: (20,0,20)-(20,20,20) â€” which is G (20,0,20) to D(20,20,20)? Wait, but GH as 20,20,20? If D is G(20,0,20) connected to H(0,20,20) ? No.

Wait, no. Let's confirm top face.

Suppose top face (z=20) vertices are:

F(0,0,20), G(20,0,20), D(20,20,20), H(0,20,20).

Therefore edges:

FG: (0,0,20)-(20,0,20): along x-axis

GD: (20,0,20)-(20,20,20): along y-axis

DH: (20,20,20)-(0,20,20): along x-axis back to H

HF: (0,20,20)-(0,0,20): along y-axis down to F.

Therefore, four edges on top face.

Therefore, the full 12 edges:

Front face (z=0):

AB (+x), BC (+y), CE (-x), EA (-y)

Vertical edges:

AF (+z), BG (+z), CD (+z), but CD is BC moved upwards, EH (+z from E(0,20,0) to H(0,20,20))

Top face:

FG (+x), GD (+y), DH (-x), HF (-y)

So that adds up to 12 edges.

So the plane of interest (2x -2y + z =10) will intersect some of these edges.

Therefore, we need to check intersections on all 12 edges.

I can create a systematic way to check each edge, parameterize it, and check if the parameter falls within [0,1] (edge), thus finding the intersection point.

But since in our coordinate system, edges are of length 20, but the conventional parameterization would be from 0 to 20. Let me proceed.

First, list of edges and their parametric equations:

1. AB: from A(0,0,0) to B(20,0,0).Direction vector (20,0,0).Parametric eq: (x,0,0) with x in [0,20]

2. BC: from B(20,0,0) to C(20,20,0).Direction vector (0,20,0).Parametric eq: (20,y,0), y in [0,20]

3. CE: from C(20,20,0) to E(0,20,0). Direction vector (-20,0,0).Parametric eq: (x,20,0), x in [20,0] ?

But parameterization could take x from 20 to 0, but edges have endpoints from t=0 to t=1. Let me use t in [0,1], with points defined as initial + t*(vector).

So for edge CE: Start at C(20,20,0). Direction vector (-20,0,0).So parametric equation: (20 -20t, 20, 0) for t in [0,1]

Similarly.

4. EA: from E(0,20,0) to A(0,0,0).Direction vector (0,-20,0).Parametric eq: (0, 20 -20t, 0)

5. AF: from A(0,0,0) to F(0,0,20).Direction vector (0,0,20).Parametric: (0,0,20t)

6. BG: from B(20,0,0) to G(20,0,20).Parametric eq: (20,0,20t)

7. CD: from C(20,20,0) to D(20,20,20).Parametric: (20,20,20t)

8. EH: from E(0,20,0) to H(0,20,20).Parametric: (0,20,20t)

9. FG: from F(0,0,20) to G(20,0,20).Parametric: (20t, 0, 20)

10. GD: from G(20,0,20) to D(20,20,20).Parametric: (20,20t,20)

11. DH: from D(20,20,20) to H(0,20,20).Parametric: (20-20t,20,20)

12. HF: from H(0,20,20) to F(0,0,20).Parametric: (0,20-20t,20)

So for each edge, defined by parametric equations.

Now, for Each edge, we substitute its parametric equations into the plane equation 2x -2y + z =10, solve for parameter t. If t is between 0 and 1, that's an intersection point.

So let's check each edge.

Edge AB: parametric (x,0,0) with x from 0 to20. Substitute in plane equation:

2x -2(0) +1(0) =10 â‡’ 2x =10 â‡’ x=5

Which occurs at x=5. So the point is (5,0,0). But this is on AB. Wait, point P is at (5,0,0). So this is already known, since point P is on AB, Q and R are defined on BC and CD. Therefore, plane PQR intersects edge AB at P.

Edge BC: parametric (20, y,0), y from 0 to20. Substitute:

2(20) -2y +0 =10 â‡’40 -2y =10â‡’2y=30â‡’y=15. So y=15.

This is exactly point Q (20,15,0).Edge BC intersects at Q.

Edge CE: parametric equation (20âˆ’20t, 20,0). Plug into plane equation:

2*(20-20t) -2*20 +0=10 â‡’40 -40t -40=10 â‡’-40t=10â‡’t= -0.25. Which is outside [0,1]. Therefore, no intersection on CE.

Edge EA: parametric (0,20-20t,0). Plug into 2x-2y + z=10:

0 -2*(20 -20t) +0 =10 â‡’ -40 +40t =10â‡’40t=50â‡’t=50/40=1.25. Which is outside [0,1]. So no intersection.

Edge AF: parametric (0,0,20t).2*0 -2*0 +20t=10â‡’20t=10â‡’t=0.5, z=10.

So intersection point is (0,0,10). Which is along edge AF. So this is a new intersection point.

Edge BG:parametric (20,0,20t). Plug into equation:

2*20 -0 +20t=10 â‡’40 +20t=10â‡’20t= -30â‡’t= -1.5. No.

Edge CD: parametric (20,20,20t). Plug into plane:

2*20 -2*20 +20t=10 â‡’40 -40 +20t=10 â‡’20t=10â‡’t=0.5â‡’z=10. So intersection point: R is at (20,20,10). Which is exactly point R on CD, as defined. So plane intersects CD at R.

Edge EH: parametric (0,20,20t) plug into plane:0 -40 +20t=10â‡’20t=50â‡’t=2.5. No.

Edge FG: parametric (20t,0,20). Plug into equation:

2*(20t) -0 +20=10â‡’40t +20=10â‡’40t= -10â‡’t= -0.25. No.

Edge GD: parametric (20,20t,20). Plug into equation:

2*20 -2*(20t) +20=10â‡’40 -40t +20=10â‡’-40t= -50â‡’t=1.25. Out of range.

Edge DH: parametric (20âˆ’20t,20,20). Plug into equation:

2*(20 -20t) -2*20 +20=10 â‡’40 -40t -40 +20=10 â‡’(-40t +20)=10â‡’-40t= -10â‡’t=0.25. So t=0.25, so coordinates:

x=20 -20*0.25=15, y=20, z=20. So (15,20,20). So this intersection is at point (15,20,20) on edge DH. Since DH goes from D(20,20,20) to H(0,20,20), at t=0.25, which is like moving 25% from D to H. So this is an intersection point.

Edge HF: parametric (0,20âˆ’20t,20). plug into equation:

0 -2*(20-20t) + 20=10 â‡’-40 +40t +20=10â‡’40t -20=10â‡’40t=30â‡’t=0.75. Thus, coordinates: (0,20 -20*0.75,20)=(0,20-15,20)=(0,5,20). So intersection point at (0,5,20).

Therefore, total intersection points:

Edge AB: P(5,0,0) - given.

Edge BC: Q(20,15,0)-given.

Edge CD: R(20,20,10)-given.

Edge AF: (0,0,10)

Edge DH: (15,20,20)

Edge HF: (0,5,20)

Other edges either intersect outside the parameter or before. Confirming, we have 6 intersection points:

1. P(5,0,0)

2. (0,0,10)

3. Q(20,15,0)

4. R(20,20,10)

5. (15,20,20)

6. (0,5,20)

Thus, the intersection polygon is a hexagon with these six vertices.

But wait, need to check the order?

To plot this polygon in 3D space to compute the area, we need to arrange the points in cyclic order along the polygon.

Alternatively, since the edges of the cube correspond to movement through coordinates, the connection between points can be determined based on their coordinates.

Alternatively, to order them, perhaps adjacent edges.

But difficult.

Alternatively, projecting the hexagon onto a plane where the area can be computed more easily. Or using the shoelace formula in 3D, triangulate the polygon, etc.

But this is tricky.

Alternatively, observe that since the plane cuts through the cube, the polygon is a hexagon, and given all coordinates, perhaps coordinates of these six points can be used to compute area via vectors.

Alternatively, divide the hexagon into simpler components.

Alternatively, calculate 3D coordinates and employ the method of averaging.

But let me list the points again:

1. P(5,0,0)

2. S: intersection on AF: (0,0,10)

3. Q(20,15,0)

4. R(20,20,10)

5. T: intersection on DH: (15,20,20)

6. U: intersection on HF: (0,5,20)

Now, need to order these points so that they form the polygon. Going around the polygon.

Wait, edges of the polygon lie on the faces of the cube.

So each edge of the polygon lies on both the plane PQR and one face of the cube.

Thus, adjacency can be determined by the intersection points moving from face to face.

Starting from point P(5,0,0) on edge AB, which is part of front face (z=0). The next points moving along the polygon should be on adjacent cube faces.

But if the plane passes from front face to the left face (x=0), and also upward, etc.

Alternatively, path:

From P(5,0,0):

Through edge AB, but AB is already connected to front face. The point P is on AB, which connects to front face and left face? Wait, x to P.

But perhaps the plane first goes from P(5,0,0) upwards along edge AF to point S(0,0,10) However, edge AF isn't adjacent to AB. Wait, unless the polygon goes S-P. But need to check.

Alternatively, the plane intersects edges at these points: P,S,Q,R,T,U. Need to arrange them appropriately.

But since the hexagon is convex, it must be a convex polygon. If we can figure out the adjacency, order, then compute area.

Alternatively, parametrize the polygon vertices in order.

Alternatively, project the polygon onto a 2D plane, compute the area.

But to do that.

First, define a coordinate system on the plane of the polygon.

Alternatively, pick two orthogonal vectors in the plane.

Alternatively, use the formula for area of planar polygon in 3D: (1/2)|(sum of cross products)|

Yes. For a planar polygon in space, we can compute the area by choosing a point then triangulating with all other points, sum total norm, then (1/2) the magnitude.

Alternatively, use formula:

If we have a polygon with vertices v1, v2, ..., vn forming a planar polygon, the area can be computed as (1/2) the magnitude of the sum over i=1 to n of (vi cross vi+1), where vn+1 = v1.

But we need vertices to be ordered either clockwise or anticlockwise.

Alternatively, projection.

But perhaps easiest once the vertices are ordered.

So let me attempt to order the points.

Based on their positions on the cube.

Starting with P(5,0,0), then going to Q(20,15,0), R(20,20,10), T(15,20,20), U(0,5,20), S(0,0,10). Then back to P.

Or perhaps another order.

Alternatively, here's another thought. The intersection polygon will pass through various faces of the cube, and moving from one face to an adjacent face. So consider traveling along the edges AB, BC, CD, vertical edges.

But perhaps the order can be obtained by listing the intersections in the order encountered when moving around the cube.

Alternatively, let me consider the different intersection points:

On front face (z=0): points P and Q.

On left face (x=0): points S and U.

On back face (z=20): ?

On right face (x=20): points Q, R, and? T is on x=15 which moves backward from D.

Alternatively, as the plane PQR cuts through front, left, back, right, top, and bottom faces? Probably not. Maybe passing through different cubes. Alternatively, considering the coordinates, we can see:

From P(5,0,0) along front face (but front face here is z=0. Then plane PQR moves upward.

Wait, alternative way. If the polygon is the intersection of the cube and the plane, then it is a closed polygon whose edges lie on the plane and on the cube's faces.

Thus, the polygon can be ordered by moving from one intersection edge to the next.

Perhaps we can list them by the edges as found, but grouped by the edges of the cube.

But given intersection points on edges:

1. AB: P(5,0,0)

2. BC: Q(20,15,0)

3. CD: R(20,20,10)

4. DH: T(15,20,20)

5. HF: U(0,5,20)

6. AF: S(0,0,10)

But these edges aren't connected in order.

But in terms of where on the cube:

Edge AB (x-axis front) intersected at P.

Edge BC (front right y-axis) intersected at Q.

Edge CD (back upright z-axis), moving up to R.

Then Edge DH (top face back along x-axis) to T.

Edge HF (top face left along y-axis down to F) is HF, where at U.

Edge AF (left edge down along z-axis) from U to S(0,0,z=10) on AF.

Then back to edge AB? Not directly. Wait.

But maybe the trajectory is through these edges:

Start from P(5,0,0) which is on AB, moving upwards through the plane inside the cube, cutting AF at S(0,0,10).

Then, on left face (x=0), moving from S(0,0,10) upwards along AF? But no, AF goes from (0,0,0) up to (0,0,20). Point S is in the middle. Alternatively, the polygon path seems rather complex.

Alternatively, imagine the polygon passing front face (z=0) through P and Q, then upward, cutting CD at R; then on the right back face at T(15,20,20); then moving left on HF to U; then down on AF to S; then to P. Wait, but need adjacency.

Alternatively, to construct the polygon:

Imagine moving along the polygon from P(5,0,0). The edges leaving P must go towards the interior of the cube, along the plane.

P(5,0,0), the plane equation is 2x -2y + z =10. At P: 2*5 -0 +0=10â€”OK.

The outgoing edges from P in the polygon would be along the plane direction. However, in the cube, adjacent edges intersecting the plane.

But according to found intersection points, from P(5,0,0), the plane cuts the cube next at which edge?

S(0,0,10)â€”along edge AFâ€”moving from front-left-bottom upward to top.

Alternatively, connect P to S. But need to verify whether P connects to S in the polygon. Whether P and S are adjacent.

Assuming the polygon is a closed loop, to get ordered points, perhaps to transform into a 2D coordinate system.

An effective strategy for the area is to use the following formula for the area of a polygon in 3D space:

Area = (1/2)|Î£_{i=1}^n (Vi Ã— Vi+1)|, where Vi are vectors from the origin, but actually this magnitude is equivalent to something else.

Alternatively, realize that the area can be computed by projecting the polygon onto a plane where the projection is area-preserving (if possible), which is orthogonal to the plane normal.

Since the polygon lies on a plane with normal N = (2, -2,1), then the area projected onto a plane with normal Nâ€™ would scale by the angle between N and Nâ€™, but maybe it's complicated.

Alternatively, compute the area via coordinates. If we can parameterize the polygon.

Alternatively, use the area formula: for a polygon described by vertices v1, v2, ..., in order, the area is (1/2)||sum_{i=1}^{n} vi Ã— vi+1||, but unsure.

Alternatively, another method is to use the following. Since the polygon is in a plane, select a point in the plane, then split the polygon into triangles, sum the areas. Each triangle area can be found via cross product, then total area.

Alternatively, use the formula here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon#Area

In 3D,the area can be calculated as half the magnitude of the cross product summed over adjacent vertices. So proper way.

Formula:

 A = 1/2 \| \sum_{i=1}^{n} (P_i \times P_{i+1}) \| 

 where P_{n+1} = P_1

But this is incorrect. Wait, no. The cross product approach is for a planar polygon. The correct formula involves using the norm of the plane.

Alternatively, if you have 4 or more points, a better method is necessary.

Alternatively, what I can do is to use coordinates.

First, choose arbitrary ordered points, compute vectors between consecutive points. Since the hexagon is convex, the cross product magnitude over the edges should contribute to area.

Alternatively, perhaps.

But maybe another way:

Let me copy coordinates of the six points:

1. P(5,0,0)

2. S(0,0,10)

3. U(0,5,20)

4. T(15,20,20)

5. R(20,20,10)

6. Q(20,15,0)

Wait, letâ€™s test if this ordering is consecutive.

Now, in 3D.

But needs to be check whether the traversal from P to S to U to T to R to Q to P is correctly following the edges.

But it's hard. Alternatively, use a projection. Let me project the polygons coordinates onto a 2D plane. To do that, get a coordinate system on the plane.

Given the plane equation: 2x -2y + z =10. So to map points on the plane to 2D coordinates, create a coordinate system with basis vectors.

First, compute two non-parallel vectors lying on the plane.

For example, from P(5,0,0) to S(0,0,10): vector PS = (-5,0,10)

From P(5,0,0) to Q(20,15,0): vector PQ = (15,15,0)

These two vectors are on the plane. Cross Product of PS and PQ:PSÃ—PQ = |i j k; -5 0 10;15 15 0 | =

i*(0*0 -10*15) -j*(-5*0 -10*15)+k*(-5*15 -0*15 )

=i*(-150) -j*(150)+k*(-75)

= (-150, -150, -75)

The magnitude squared: 150^2 +150^2 +75^2 =33750 + 5625=39375. sqrt(39375)=approx198.4 etc.

Not useful.

Alternatively, compute UV basis for the plane. But perhaps parameterization is complex. Alternatively since we can compute the area via the magnitude of (normal)/2 * perimeter? Wait no.

Alternatively, realize that the area in 3D space can be calculated by taking a parametrization, integral.

But no, for a planar polygon the area can be calculated as (1/(2*|n| )) times the sum over edges of edge vector1 cross vector2 dot n, where n is normal. But in correct formula...

Wait, for a polygon on a plane with unit normal vector N, the area is (1/2) sum_{i=1}^N ( P_i cross P_{i+1} ) dot Nã€‚

Here, the plane has normal vector N=(2, -2,1). So |N|=sqrt(4 +4 +1)=sqrt(9)=3.

Thus, the normalized unit normal is (2/3, -2/3,1/3).

Thus, if we arrange the polygon as a list of points ordered either CW or CCW around the plane with respect to N), then  Area = (1/2)*| cross_n ( edges ) |; that is, Area = (1/(2* |N| )) * |sum_{i=1}^n ( (P_{i+1} - Pi) cross (P_i - P_0) ) dot N |.

No, probably not working.

Alternatively, since the normal vector is (2,-2,1):

Area = (1/ (2 * |N| )) * sum_{i=1}^n | (Pi x Pj) Â· N ), but  find that my memory's vague.

Wait, actual formula: For a polygon in 3D with unit normal vector n, the area is (1/2)*|sum_{i=1}^{n} (Vi Ã— Vi+1) â‹… n |

where Vi are the vertices,ordered such that the traversal is consistent with the normal.

We know that for a simple polygon with vertices ordered either clockwise or counter-clockwise.

The formula (1/2)| sum_{i=1}^n ( (Vi Ã— Vi+1) â‹… n ) |.

Since n = (2, -2,1)/3.Thus, we can need to order the points appropriately.

Thus, first, order the points in a rotational order (right-hand rule around n). Let me attempt such an order.

Take points:

1. P(5,0,0)

2. Q(20,15,0)

3. R(20,20,10)

4. T(15,20,20)

5. U(0,5,20)

6. S(0,0,10)

Back to P.

This order may rotate around the normal.

Let me verify the traversal.

Vi Ã— Vi+1:

First, point list:

1. P(5,0,0)

2. Q(20,15,0)

3. R(20,20,10)

4. T(15,20,20)

5. U(0,5,20)

6. S(0,0,10)

Then back to P.

Compute each pair (Vi, Vj).

Compute PQ = Q - P = (15,15,0)

QR = R - Q = (0,5,10)

RT = T - R = (-5,0,10)

TU = U - T = (-15,-15,0)

US = S - U = (0,-5, -10)

SP = P - S = (5,0, -10)

Then, sum over Vi Ã— Vi+1.

Actually, sum the cross products of consecutive vertices? Not vectors but cross products of the vertices. Wait,no,  what exactly gives edge pairs.

Wait, this (Vi Ã— Vi+1)) refers to cross product of the actual vectors (coordinates) around the polygon. But confusion.

Wait, sorry, no. The actual vectors are positions in space. According to the formula, the sum (Vi Ã— Vi+1) Â· n. So compute each vertex coordinates, take cross product with next vertex, then sum all, then dot with n, take magnitude times 1/2.

Waitâ€”clarifying.

More accurately, the vertices are points in 3D space. So given in terms of position vectors.

The formula says Area=(1/2)|sum_{i=1}^n Vi Ã— Vi+1|ã€‚But since, in this sum, cross product sum doesn't account for the plane's normal's effect. Alternatively, maybe not.

Wait, maybe.

Yes, according to the reference(https://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/areas/areas.htm)ã€‚

For a planar polygon in 3D, with a known normal vector, area will be (1/2) * | sum_{i=0}^n (Vi Ã— Vi+1) Â· N | / |N|

But you really need the projected area onto the plane orthogonal to N. Hmm, depends on.

The reference says, the area is given by:

A = (1/2) * | sum_{i} (Vi Ã— Vi+1) | (overlay if polygon is 2D in xy plane, A = (1/2)| sum_i (xi*yi+1 - xi+1*yi) | )

But in 3D, and assuming Polygon lies on plane orthogonal to some Normal, then:

A = (1/(2* sin(theta)) ) * | sum_{i} (Vi Ã— Vi+1 Â· N) |, etc. Not sure.

Alternatively,a straightforward formula:If we can map the coordinates onto a coordinate system in the plane, then compute the area.

Alternatively, to compute edge vectors in the plane and use them as a basis.

Alternatively, given the shoelace formula wonâ€™t work unless coordinates are projected onto two dimensions.

But projecting onto 2D space may works to allow use of the standard area formula.

Here's a method:

1. Choose a coordinate system on the plane. Need three non-collinear points on the plane; create 2D coordinates for all vertices.

But given six points, it's a bit cumbersome.

Alternatively, choose vectors for two axes in the plane, such as PQ(15,15,0) and PS(-5,0,10). Then,  express each point in terms of coordinates with that basis, then use the area calculation via shoelace formula.

But this requires converting all point coordinates to basis vectors.

But complicated.

Alternatively, the area of a polygon in 3D space with verticesVi can be calculated via:

A = (1/2) * sqrt( [sum_{i=1}^n (yi zi+1 - yi+1 zi)]^2 + [sum(zi xi+1 - z i+1 xi)]^2 + [sum(xi yi+1 - xi+1 yi)]^2 )

This is derived from the formula |(1/2) sum Vi Ã— Vi+1|, as norm of the cross productâ€™s components.

So let me compute each component:

Let vertices ordered as P, Q, R, T, U, S, P.

Their coordinates:

P: (5,0,0)

Q: (20,15,0)

R: (20,20,10)

T: (15,20,20)

U: (0,5,20)

S: (0,0,10)

Again, vertices need to ordered correctly.

Assuming this order.

Compute three components:

Sum over i:

S1 = sum over [(y_i * z_{i+1} - y_{i+1} * z_i)]

S2 = sum over [(z_i * x_{i+1} - z_{i+1} * x_i)]

S3 = sum over [(x_i * y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} * y_i)]

However, the order of traversal (the path) has to be correct, clockwise or counter-clockwise.

Assuming the order is correct (assuming forming a planar polygon with normal vector).

Perhaps.

So compute S1, S2, S3 first.

Order P(5,0,0); Q(20,15,0); R(20,20,10); T(15,20,20); U(0,5,20); S(0,0,10); P(5,0,0).

Now proceed step by step:

Between P and Q:

(y_i=0, z_i=0; y_{i+1}=15, z_{i+1}=0.

S1+=(0*0 -15*0)=0

S2+=(0*20 -0*5) =0*20 -0*5= ? wait, for segmentsS PQ:

For first vertex pair P (5,0,0) and Q(20,15,0):

Component contributions:

For S1:

(y_i * z_{i+1} - y_{i+1} * z_i) = 0*0 -15*0 =0

For S2:

(z_i * x_{i+1} - z_{i+1} * x_i)=0*20 -0*5=0

For S3:

(x_i * y_{i+1} -x_{i+1} * y_i)=5*15 -20 *0=75 -0=75

Second pair Q(20,15,0) and R(20,20,10):

Components:

S1:15*10 -20*0=150

S2:0*20 -10*20= -200

S3: 20*20 -20*15=400 -300=100

Third pair R(20,20,10) and T(15,20,20):

Components:

S1:20*20 -20*10=400 -200=200

S2:10*15 -20*20=150 -400= -250

S3: 20*20 -15*20=400 -300=100

Fourth pair T(15,20,20) and U(0,5,20):

Components:

S1:20*20 -5*20=400 -100=300

S2:20*0 -20*15=0 -300=-300

S3:15*5 -0*20=75 -0=75

Fifth pair U(0,5,20) and S(0,0,10):

Components:

S1:5*10 -0*20=50 -0=50

S2:20*0 -10*0=0 -0=0

S3:0*0 -0*5=0 -0=0

Sixth pair S(0,0,10) and P(5,0,0):

Components:

S1:0*0 -0*10=0 -0=0

S2:10*5 -0*0=50 -0=50

S3:0*0 -5*0=0 -0=0

Let's sum them up.

Breakdown as per pairs:

PQ: S1=0, S2=0, S3=75

QR: S1=150, S2=-200, S3=100

RT: S1=200, S2=-250, S3=100

TU: S1=300, S2=-300, S3=75

US: S1=50, S2=0, S3=0

SP: S1=0, S2=50, S3=0

Sum:

S1_total =0+150 +200 +300 +50 +0= 700

S2_total=0 +(-200)+(-250)+(-300)+0+50= -200 -250= -450; -450 -300= -750; -750+50=-700

S3_total=75 +100 +100 +75 +0 +0=350

Therefore,

Sum = S1:700, S2:-700,S3:350.

Now, area = (1/2)*sqrt(S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2)= (1/2)*sqrt{7002 + (-700)^2 + 3502}= (1/2)*sqrt(490000 +490000 + 122500)= (1/2)*sqrt(1102500).

1102500: sqrt(1102500)=sqrt(1225*900)=35*30=1050? Wait, 352=1225, 302=900. 1225*900=1,102,500.

Yes, so sqrt(1,102,500)=1050

Thus, Area=1/2 * 1050=525.

However, I might have the order of the vertices incorrect. Let me confirm.

This result 525 is plausible?

However, since S1, S2, S3 each give scalar values whose square sum is (7002 +7002 +3502) but sqrt of that. Wait, S1 was 700, S2 was -700, S3 350.

Wait yes, contributions:

7002 is 490000 Ã—2 (from S1 and S2)= 980000, and 3502=122500, total1,102,500. So Square root is 1050, hence area 525.

But based on the ordering I used, the area is 525.

But I have to ensure that the points are indeed ordered properly in a non-intersecting polygon.

If the points are ordered correctly either clockwise or counter-clockwise around the normal, then the calculation is correct.

Given the way we ordered the points (P â†’ Q â†’ R â†’ T â†’ U â†’ S â†’ P), the contributions were summed and the total is 525.

Thus, if this ordering traverses the polygon properly, then area would be 525.

But sanity check: If each edge of the cube is 20, then the largest area possible (cross-section area as a diagonal) would be some rectangles, like 20x20â‰ˆ28.28 diagonal would have area â‰ˆ28.28 *20â‰ˆ565. However, 525 is slightly below this, which seems plausible considering the plane slices through.

Moreover plane intersects the cube forming a hexagon. Hexagons within a cube can have maximum area... Depends, but possibly 525 seems reasonable.

Thus, thinking the answer is 525.

But I need to verify the order. If for each edge traversal, the cross product was taken correctly, then.

Moreover, coordinate computation step-by-step confirms.

Thus, based on the calculation above, we can write the solution as boxed{525}

**Final Answer**
\boxed{525}
