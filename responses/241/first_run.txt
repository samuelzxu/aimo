Okay, let's go through the Deepseek Thinking Trajectory to identify the essential tokens for future reasoning steps. The problem involves finding the number of whoosits produced in the third scenario, given different worker-hour constraints for widgets and whoosits.

First, the key steps in the reasoning are establishing the worker-hours required per widget (w) and per whoosit (h) using the first two scenarios. Then, these values are used to solve for m in the third scenario. The critical parts include setting up the equations from the scenarios, solving them to find w and h, and substituting these into the third equation to find m.

1. **Equations Setup**: The first two scenarios lead to two equations:
   - 300w + 200h = 100 (from the first scenario)
   - 240w + 300h = 120 (from the second scenario)

   These equations are simplified and solved to find w = 1/7 and h = 2/7.

2. **Solving for m**: Using the derived values of w and h, the third scenario's equation:
   - 150w + mh = 150 worker-hours
   - Substituting w and h gives m = 450.

The essential tokens include the derived equations, the solved values of w and h, and the substitution steps leading to m. These parts are crucial for validating the solution and ensuring the correctness of the final answer.
