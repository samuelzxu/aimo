Okay, I need to figure out which tokens are essential for the reasoning process here. Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step.

First, the problem is about finding points in a square that are 100-ray partitional but not 60-ray partitional. The solution involves understanding that such points must have coordinates with specific rational denominators.

The key steps in the reasoning are:
1. For a point to be n-ray partitional, its coordinates must be fractions with denominators dividing n/2.
2. For n=100, the denominators are 50, leading to (49)^2 = 2401 points.
3. For n=60, the denominators are 30, leading to (29)^2 = 841 points.
4. Points common to both must have denominators that are divisors of both 50 and 30, which is gcd(50,30)=10. This gives (9)^2 = 81 points.
5. Subtracting the common points gives 2401 - 81 = 2320.

The critical information here involves the formulas for the number of points based on n, the gcd calculation, and the final subtraction. These parts are essential for future reasoning steps.

Now, identifying the tokens to keep:
- The definition of n-ray partitional points needing coordinates with denominators dividing n/2.
- Calculation for 100-ray (denominator 50) leading to 49x49.
- Calculation for 60-ray (denominator 30) leading to 29x29.
- Determining the gcd(50,30)=10 leading to denominator 10 and 9x9 points.
- The final subtraction of 2401 - 81 = 2320.

These sections contain the core logical steps necessary to arrive at the answer and must be retained for future reasoning.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 5: <keep>I recall a similar problem from the 2011 AMC12A problem 23, which involved 4-ray partitional points. The solution there involved the coordinates needing to satisfy certain fractions. For a point to be n-ray partitional, perhaps both coordinates have to be fractions with denominator n/2, given that for n even, each direction (horizontal and vertical) needs to have n/2 partitions.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 1: <keep>From research, a point is n-ray partitional in a square if and only if its coordinates are (p, q) where p and q are rational numbers with denominators dividing n/2.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 3: <keep>for n=100, which is even, n=100 implies k=50, so the number of 100-ray partitional points would be (50-1)^2=49*49=2401.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 4: <keep>Similarly, 60-ray partitional points would require coordinates with denominators 60/2=30, so they are points (i/30, j/30) where i,j from 1 to 29. Therefore, the number of 60-ray partitional points is (30-1)^2=29*29=841.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 5: <keep>The points that are common to both? The points that are 100-ray and 60-ray partitional must be points whose coordinates have denominators dividing both 50 and 30. The least common multiple of 50 and 30 is 150. So, the common denominators would be 150, so denominators dividing 150.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 7: <keep>The gcd(50,30)=10. Hence, coordinates are multiples of 1/10. Therefore, (i/10, j/10), i,j=1 to 9. Total points 9*9=81.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, the number of points that are 100-ray but not 60-ray partitional is 2401 - 81=2320.</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 4: <keep>The answer choices are numbers like 1500, 1560, 2320, etc., so it's a large number, implying a combinatorial computation.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 2: <keep>each triangle should have an area of 1/n.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 2: <keep>Therefore, if n is even, let's say n=2k, then p and q must be multiples of 1/k.</keep>
