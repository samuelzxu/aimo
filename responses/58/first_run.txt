Okay, let's go through the problem step by step. The question is about an exam with k parts, each part having a certain number of questions and answer choices. The key is to relate the probabilities of getting exactly one question correct versus none, and then find k which makes that ratio 2018. 

First, we need to calculate the probability of getting no questions correct, P(0), and the probability of getting exactly one correct, P(1). For each part i, the probability of getting a question wrong is i/(i+1), so for all questions in part i, it's (i/(i+1))^i. P(0) is the product of these across all parts.

For P(1), we need the sum of probabilities for getting exactly one question right in any part, with all others wrong. For each part i, there's a term accounting for one correct and the rest wrong. When simplifying, each term's contribution to P(1) turns out to be equal to P(0). Summing across all k parts gives P(1) = k * P(0). Setting this equal to 2018 * P(0) gives k = 2018.

Finally, the total number of questions is the sum from 1 to 2018, which is 2018*2019/2. Calculating this gives the answer.

Now, identifying which tokens are essential to keep for future reasoning steps. The main points are the definitions of P(0) and P(1), the simplification leading to P(1) = k * P(0), the conclusion that k = 2018, and the summation formula for the total questions. These parts are crucial for reconstructing the logic without redoing all calculations.
