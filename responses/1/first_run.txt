Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to show there exists a point y in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space H such that when each point x in S is translated by y and scaled by √2/d, the resulting set forms an orthonormal system. 

First, I need to recall what an orthonormal system requires: each vector must have a norm of 1, and any two distinct vectors must be orthogonal. Given that all points in S are at a distance d apart, translating and scaling them should achieve this. 

If we denote v_x = (√2/d)(x - y), then v_x must satisfy ||v_x|| = 1 and ⟨v_x, v_x'⟩ = 0 for x ≠ x'. This translates back to conditions on y: ||x - y|| = d/√2 and ⟨x - y, x' - y⟩ = 0 for all distinct x, x' in S. 

Using the parallelogram law on ||x - x'||², we derived that if y is equidistant from all x in S at distance d/√2, the inner product ⟨x - y, x' - y⟩ must be zero. This leads to the conclusion that such a y must be the common center of spheres around each x ∈ S with radius d/√2. 

Considering the properties of infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, we noted that any finite subset of S allows for such a y due to the finite intersection property of closed convex sets. Since H is complete, the intersection of all these spheres is non-empty, guaranteeing the existence of y. 

Finally, the infinite-dimensional nature of H allows for the necessary orthonormal system to exist when scaled and translated appropriately, ensuring the required properties hold for the entire set S.
