Alright, let's tackle this problem where two objects are connected via a heat engine. The goal is to find the final temperature T_f and the total work done W. Since the problem mentions two objects without specifying their heat capacities, I'll assume they are identical, which is a common textbook scenario.

First, recalling that when a reversible engine (like a Carnot engine) operates between two finite reservoirs, the process continues until both reach the same temperature, T_f. The key here is entropy maximization. For a reversible process, the total entropy change should be zero.

For two identical objects with heat capacity C, initial temperatures T₁ and T₂, the entropy change for each object is:

- For the hot object: ΔS₁ = C ln(T_f / T₁)
- For the cold object: ΔS₂ = C ln(T_f / T₂)

Setting the total entropy change to zero: ΔS₁ + ΔS₂ = 0 → ln(T_f² / (T₁ T₂)) = 0 → T_f = √(T₁ T₂).

Next, energy conservation: The heat lost by the hot object is Q₁ = C(T₁ - T_f), and the heat gained by the cold object is Q₂ = C(T_f - T₂). The work done W is the difference: W = Q₁ - Q₂ = C(T₁ + T₂ - 2T_f). Substituting T_f gives W = C(T₁ + T₂ - 2√(T₁ T₂)).

These steps rely on recognizing the problem as a classic entropy maximization scenario with identical heat capacities. Ensuring the steps logically flow from thermodynamic principles to the final formulas is crucial.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 3: <keep>since they are finite, their temperatures will change as heat is transferred. So, this isn't a steady-state situation like a typical Carnot cycle between infinite reservoirs. Instead, the temperatures of both objects will change until they reach a common final temperature</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 2: <keep>but here instead of just exchanging heat directly, they do so through a heat engine which extracts work. The key difference must be that part of the energy is converted into work, so the final temperature won't just be the weighted average (based on their heat capacities) that you get when they exchange heat directly.</keep>
