Okay, let's start by breaking down the problem. The goal is to find the gravitational force acting on a displaced core within a liquid planet. The core has been moved 1 km from the center, and we need to calculate the restoring force. 

First, the key parameters are the planet's radius, the core's radius and mass, the liquid's density, and the displacement. The core is denser than the surrounding liquid, so when displaced, there's a restoring force due to the liquid's gravitational pull.

The crucial insight here is using the concept of a displaced spherical cavity in a uniform density sphere. By superposition, the gravitational field inside an off-center cavity is uniform and proportional to the displacement. This field, when multiplied by the core's mass, gives the restoring force.

The formula derived is F = (4/3)πGρmx. Plugging in the given values for gravitational constant, liquid density, core mass, and displacement, the calculation leads to approximately 1.0 × 10¹³ N. This aligns with the problem's constraints and the assumption R ≫ r, validating the approach.
