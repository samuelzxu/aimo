Okay, let me go through the problem again to make sure I capture all the essential parts needed for future reasoning. The problem involves finding the equation of a common tangent line to two parabolas and then determining the area bounded by these parabolas and the tangent line.

First, in part (1), the key steps were setting up the equations for the tangent line by ensuring that the discriminants of the quadratic equations obtained by substituting the line into each parabola are zero. This led to two equations which were solved to find the slope (m) and y-intercept (c) of the tangent line. The crucial part here is the derivation of the discriminants and solving the resulting system of equations to find m and c. These steps are essential because they directly lead to the equation of the tangent line.

In part (2), the area calculation required identifying the bounds of integration and the functions to integrate. The points where the tangent line touches the parabolas (-3a/4 and 3a/4) and the intersection of the parabolas at the origin (0) are critical for setting up the limits of integration. The integrands were simplified to perfect squares, which made the integration straightforward. Recognizing that the integrands factor into squares is a key insight here, as it simplifies the computation significantly.

I need to mark the essential tokens that capture these critical steps. For part (1), the discriminants, solving for m and c, and verification steps are crucial. For part (2), the points of tangency, the intersection of parabolas, setting up the integrals with correct limits, and the integration process using perfect squares are vital. These elements must be retained for any subsequent reasoning or verification.
