Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangular box (parallelepiped) and we need to find its volume given the shortest distances from the space diagonal to the edges it doesn't meet. The distances are given as 2√5, 30/√13, and 15/√10. 

First, I need to recall that the space diagonal of a rectangular box with sides a, b, c is √(a² + b² + c²). But the problem isn't about the diagonal's length directly. Instead, it's about the shortest distance from this diagonal to the edges not intersecting it. 

Hmm, I think the key here is understanding how to compute the distance between two skew lines in 3D space. The space diagonal and each edge it doesn't meet are skew lines. The formula for the distance between two skew lines involves the cross product of their direction vectors and a connecting vector between them. Let me remember the formula: the distance is |(p2 - p1) · (v1 × v2)| / |v1 × v2|, where p1 and p2 are points on each line, and v1, v2 are their direction vectors.

Let's set up the coordinates. Suppose the box has vertices at (0,0,0) and (a,b,c). The space diagonal goes from (0,0,0) to (a,b,c). An example of an edge not meeting this diagonal could be the edge from (a,0,0) to (a,b,0), which is along the y-axis at x=a. 

Calculating the distance here: points on the diagonal are (ta, tb, tc), and points on the edge are (a, s, 0), where s varies from 0 to b. The direction vectors for the diagonal and edge are (a,b,c) and (0,b,0). Wait, no, the edge is along the y-axis, so direction vector should be (0, b, 0)? Or actually, it's from (a,0,0) to (a,b,0), so the direction vector is (0, b, 0). But the diagonal's direction vector is (a, b, c). 

Using the distance formula: take points (0,0,0) on the diagonal and (a,0,0) on the edge. The vector between them is (a,0,0). The cross product of the direction vectors (a,b,c) and (0,b,0) would be... let's compute that. 

The cross product of (a,b,c) and (0,b,0) is:

i*(b*0 - c*b) - j*(a*0 - c*0) + k*(a*b - b*0)
= i*(-bc) - j*0 + k*(ab)
= (-bc, 0, ab)

The magnitude of this cross product is √(b²c² + a²b²) = b√(c² + a²).

The dot product of (a,0,0) with (-bc, 0, ab) is a*(-bc) + 0 + 0 = -abc. The absolute value is abc. 

So the distance is |abc| / (b√(a² + c²)) = (abc)/(b√(a² + c²)) = ac/√(a² + c²). 

Wait, this seems off. Let me check again. Oh, maybe I messed up the direction vectors. The edge from (a,0,0) to (a,b,0) has direction vector (0, b, 0), which can be simplified to (0,1,0) scaled by b. But in the formula, the direction vectors need to be direction vectors, so perhaps unit vectors. Wait, no, the formula works with any direction vectors. 

Wait, maybe an alternative approach: parametrize the lines. 

Space diagonal: (0,0,0) + t(a,b,c), where t ∈ [0,1].

Edge: (a,0,0) + s(0,b,0), where s ∈ [0,1].

The vector between a point on each line is (a - ta, sb - tb, -tc). To find the shortest distance, we can set up equations to minimize this distance squared. 

But using the skew lines formula is faster. Let's use that. 

The formula requires two points on each line. Let's take (0,0,0) on the diagonal and (a,0,0) on the edge. The connecting vector is (a,0,0). The direction vectors are v1 = (a,b,c) for the diagonal and v2 = (0,b,0) for the edge. 

Cross product v1 × v2 = |i j k|
                        |a b c|
                        |0 b 0|
= i*(b*0 - c*b) - j*(a*0 - c*0) + k*(a*b - b*0)
= i*(-bc) - j*0 + k*(ab)
= (-bc, 0, ab)

The magnitude of this cross product is √(b²c² + a²b²) = b√(c² + a²).

The dot product of the connecting vector (a,0,0) with the cross product is (-bc)*a + 0 + ab*0 = -abc.

Absolute value is abc. So distance is | -abc | / (b√(a² + c²)) = (abc)/(b√(a² + c²)) )= ac/√(a² + c²). 

Got it. Similarly, the distance to edges along other axes would have similar expressions. For example, distance to an edge along the y-axis might involve ab/√(a² + b²), and along the z-axis bc/√(b² + c²). But I need to confirm.

Actually, earlier when considering an edge along the x-axis, we got ac/√(a² + c²). If we consider an edge along the z-axis (say from (0,0,c) to (a,0,c)), following the same method:

Space diagonal direction vector (a,b,c), edge direction vector (a,0,0). The cross product would be (a,b,c) × (a,0,0) = (0, ac, -ab). The connecting vector from (0,0,0) to (0,0,c) is (0,0,c). The dot product with cross product gives 0*0 + ac*0 + (-ab)*c = -abc. So distance | -abc | / | cross product | which is √(0² + (ac)² + (-ab)²) = √(a²c² + a²b²) = a√(b² + c²). Thus distance is abc / (a√(b² + c²)) )= bc/√(b² + c²). 

So in total, the three distances are:

- For edges along the x-axis: bc/√(b² + c²)
- For edges along the y-axis: ac/√(a² + c²)
- For edges along the z-axis: ab/√(a² + b²)

Given the problem states these distances are 2√5, 30/√13, 15/√10. So each expression must match one of these. 

Set up the equations:

1. bc/√(b² + c²) = 2√5
2. ac/√(a² + c²) = 30/√13
3. ab/√(a² + b²) = 15/√10

Square each to remove radicals:

1. (b²c²)/(b² + c²) = 20
2. (a²c²)/(a² + c²) = 900/13
3. (a²b²)/(a² + b²) = 225/10 = 45/2

Let’s let x = a², y = b², z = c². Then:

1. yz/(y+z) = 20
2. xz/(x+z) = 900/13
3. xy/(x+y) = 45/2

Take reciprocals by dividing numerator and denominator:

1. 1/(1/y + 1/z) = 20 → 1/y + 1/z = 1/20
2. 1/(1/x + 1/z) = 900/13 → 1/x + 1/z = 13/900
3. 1/(1/x + 1/y) = 45/2 → 1/x + 1/y = 2/45

Let’s set u = 1/x, v = 1/y, w = 1/z. Now the equations:

1. v + w = 1/20
2. u + w = 13/900
3. u + v = 2/45

Subtract equation 2 from equation 3: (u + v) - (u + w) = 2/45 - 13/900 → v - w = (40/900 -13/900) = 27/900 = 3/100

Now, from equation 1: v + w = 1/20 = 5/100. So we have:

v - w = 3/100

v + w = 5/100

Adding: 2v = 8/100 → v = 4/100 = 1/25

Then w = 5/100 - v = 5/100 - 4/100 = 1/100

From equation 2: u = 13/900 - w = 13/900 -1/100 = (13/900 -9/900)=4/900=1/225

Thus:

u =1/x =1/225 → x=225 → a=15

v=1/y=1/25 → y=25 → b=5

w=1/z=1/100 → z=100 → c=10

Therefore, the volume is abc=15×5×10=750. Check:

bc/√(b² +c²) =5×10/√(25+100)=50/5√5=10/√5=2√5 ✔️

Similarly, ac/√(a² +c²)=15×10/√(225+100)=150/5√13=30/√13 ✔️

ab/√(a² +b²)=15×5/√(225+25)=75/5√10=15/√10 ✔️

All match, so the volume is 750.
