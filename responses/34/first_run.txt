Okay, I need to figure out which parts of the reasoning are essential for future steps. Let's start with the first part where the user converts the integral equation for x(t) into a differential equation. The key steps here are differentiating the integral using Leibniz's rule, substituting the integral back using the original equation, deriving the ODE, solving it with the integrating factor, and applying the initial condition. These steps are crucial because they outline the method used and the critical substitutions.

For x(t), the derivation of x'(t) = -x(t) + 2 is fundamental. The solution process involving the integrating factor exp(t) and the integration leading to x(t) = 2 - e^{-t} must be kept. The initial condition check at t=0 is also vital to confirm the constant C.

Moving to y(t), the conversion of its integral equation into a differential equation is similarly important. The differentiation using Leibniz's rule again, substitution of x(t) into the ODE for y(t), solving the linear ODE with the integrating factor exp(-t), and finding the constant using y(0)=0 are all essential steps. The verification step where they substitute back into the integral equation to check correctness is also critical as it confirms the solution's validity.

Each mathematical step that leads to the final expressions for x(t) and y(t) should be preserved, especially those involving substitutions, integrations, and initial conditions. Any equations that directly contribute to solving the ODEs or verifying the solutions are necessary. Detailed explanations of Leibniz's rule application, integrating factors, and the integration constants are key to the logic flow and must be kept.

Additionally, the final answers must be preserved to present the solutions clearly. The verification steps, including plugging back into the original equations, are important to ensure correctness and should be kept to validate the results.

Overall, the essential parts include the derivations of the differential equations, the solving processes using integrating factors, the application of initial conditions, and the verification steps. These blocks contain the critical logic and computations required to arrive at the final answers.
