Okay, let me start by understanding the problem. We have a ladder in equilibrium with a man climbing it, and we need to find the coefficient of static friction. The key forces here are the normal and frictional forces at both the wall and the floor. Since the system is in equilibrium, the sum of forces and torques must balance out. 

First, let's outline the forces. The ladder and the man each have a weight of mg acting downward. The normal force from the floor (N_floor) acts upward, while the normal force from the wall (N_wall) acts horizontally. The frictional forces oppose potential slipping: f_floor at the base to the right and f_wall at the wall upward. 

The equilibrium conditions give us two force equations. Horizontally, N_wall equals f_floor, which is μN_floor. Vertically, N_floor plus f_wall equals the total weight of 2mg, with f_wall being μN_wall. Substituting these into each other, we find N_floor in terms of μ.

Next, considering torques around the base of the ladder eliminates the floor forces from the torque equation. The torque from the ladder's weight (at L/2) and the man's weight (at 2L/3) must balance the torques from N_wall and f_wall. Calculating these torques involves the horizontal and vertical distances, which depend on the angle θ (30 degrees here).

Substituting all known values and the expressions for N_wall and f_wall in terms of μ into the torque equation leads to a quadratic equation in μ. Solving this using the quadratic formula gives us the value of μ. After carefully computing the discriminant and simplifying, we find μ ≈ 0.678 when rounded to the nearest thousandth. This makes sense as the coefficient must be sufficient to prevent slipping at both the wall and floor, given the system's equilibrium.
