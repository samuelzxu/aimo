Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, we have a circle of 2019 counters with 673 mafia and 1346 town counters. Tony goes first and can remove any subset of counters, but he doesn't know where the mafia are. Madeline knows the mafia positions and removes a town adjacent to a mafia on her turn. The goal is for Tony to ensure at least one town remains.

First, the numbers: 2019 is 3*673, and the town counters are exactly double the mafia. This seems significant. Maybe there's a way to break the circle into thirds or use the pigeonhole principle. If the mafia are spread out, each mafia has two town neighbors. If Tony can disrupt this adjacency, Madeline can't remove towns. But how?

Tony needs a strategy that works regardless of mafia placement. One idea is to divide the circle into groups. Since there are 673 mafia, maybe grouping them into triples. If Tony removes every third counter, he might break the adjacency. For example, if the circle is divided into 673 triplets, removing one counter from each triplet might isolate mafias. But without knowing where they are, how effective is this?

Another approach: Tony needs to prevent Madeline from accessing all towns. If he can ensure that after his moves, some towns aren't adjacent to mafia, those towns survive. Maybe by creating gaps or blocks. But creating gaps requires knowing where the mafia are, which he doesn't.

Wait, the key might be the number of turns. Madeline removes one town per turn, starting from 1346. If Tony removes mafia counters fast enough, the game ends before Madeline removes all towns. But how can he target mafia without knowing their positions?

Since the ratio is 2:1 town to mafia, Tony needs a strategy that leverages this. Suppose he partitions the circle into three equal parts. By the pigeonhole principle, one part has ≤224 mafia. Removing this part reduces mafia count to 449. Repeating this could eliminate all mafia before towns are gone. But is this possible without knowing which part to remove? Maybe by rotating the partitions each turn.

Alternatively, Tony could remove every third counter systematically. For instance, removing 673 counters initially might disrupt the mafia's adjacency. Even if he removes towns, the remaining towns might no longer be adjacent to mafia. However, since Madeline's moves depend on adjacency, breaking this is crucial.

Another thought: Each mafia requires two adjacent towns. If Tony can remove one town from each pair, the mafia becomes isolated. But again, without knowing which towns, he needs a pattern. Removing every other town might do this, but how to ensure.

Wait, perhaps using the structure of the circle. If Tony removes all towns in specific intervals, creating large enough gaps so that remaining towns aren't adjacent to mafia. But without knowing mafia positions, this is challenging.

However, since the problem allows any strategy regardless of Madeline's actions, Tony might use a deterministic method that covers all possibilities. For example, dividing the circle into sections and ensuring each section has non-adjacent towns after removals. Overlapping sections might protect some towns.

The final answer hinges on whether Tony can systematically remove counters in such a way that isolates towns from mafia, using the initial ratio and structure of the circle. Given the problem's symmetry and numbers, the answer is likely yes, and the strategy involves strategic partitioning and removal to break adjacency.
