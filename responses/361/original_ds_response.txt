Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to solve it step by step. Let me try to visualize the problem first. There's a circle C with radius 2, and AB is its diameter. Then there's circle D that's internally tangent to circle C at point A. Circle E is internally tangent to circle C, externally tangent to circle D, and tangent to the diameter AB. Importantly, the radius of circle D is three times the radius of circle E, and I need to find the radius of circle D in the form sqrt(m) - n and then compute m + n. Alright, let's break this down.

First, let me sketch out what I know:

1. Circle C has radius 2, so its diameter AB is 4 units long.
2. Circle D is tangent to circle C at A, and since it's internally tangent, circle D must be inside circle C. The point of tangency is A, so circle D must touch circle C exactly at point A. That means the center of circle D is along the line connecting the centers of circle C and point A. Since circle C's center is the midpoint of AB, let me denote that as point O. So, OA is 2 units (the radius). Since circle D is tangent to circle C at A, their centers and point A must lie on the same line. Therefore, the center of circle D is along OA.

Wait, OA is part of the diameter AB. If circle D is tangent to circle C at A, then the distance between their centers should be equal to the difference in their radii. Let me write that down. Let's denote the radius of circle D as r_D and radius of circle E as r_E, and we know that r_D = 3r_E. The center of circle C is O, which is the midpoint of AB, so coordinates might help here. Let me set up a coordinate system.

Let's place circle C with its center at the origin (0,0), so that diameter AB is along the x-axis from (-2, 0) to (2, 0). Wait, but the problem says that circle D is internally tangent to circle C at A. Hmm, point A is one end of the diameter. If AB is a diameter, then depending on how we place it, point A could be at (-2, 0) or (2, 0). But since the problem mentions circle D is tangent at A, and since circle D is inside circle C, the center of circle D must lie along the line OA. Wait, but OA is a radius. So if circle C is centered at O (0,0), then point A is (2, 0) if AB is from (-2, 0) to (2,0).

But I need to confirm the positions. Let me fix the coordinate system with center O at (0,0), diameter AB along the x-axis from (-2,0) to (2,0). Therefore, point A is (2,0) and point B is (-2,0). Circle D is internally tangent to circle C at A, so it must lie inside circle C and touch it only at A. Therefore, the center of circle D lies along the line OA, which is the x-axis from (0,0) to (2,0). Let me denote the center of circle D as point (h, 0). Since circle D is tangent to circle C at A (2,0), the distance between their centers must be equal to the difference in radii, right?

Because when two circles are tangent internally, the distance between centers is the difference of radii.

So, the radius of circle C is 2, and the radius of circle D is r_D. Then the distance between centers O and D is 2 - r_D. But the center D is located at (h,0). So the distance between O (0,0) and D (h,0) is |h|. But since h is along OA towards A, h must be positive. So, h = 2 - r_D. But also, because circle D is tangent to circle C at A, which is (2,0), and the center of D is at (h, 0), the distance from D to A is equal to the radius of D. Therefore, the distance from (h,0) to (2,0) is r_D. So, |2 - h| = r_D.

Therefore, |2 - h| = r_D, but h = 2 - r_D from before. Substitute h into this equation:

|2 - (2 - r_D)| = |r_D| = r_D. Which just gives r_D = r_D, so that's consistent. So both conditions give us the same equation, so we can determine that h = 2 - r_D. Hmm, that doesn't seem to give new information, but confirms the position. So center of circle D is at (2 - r_D, 0).

So far, good. Now moving on to circle E. Circle E is internally tangent to circle C, so it's inside circle C. It's externally tangent to circle D, so it's outside circle D but touching it. And it's tangent to diameter AB. Also, radius of D is three times radius of E: r_D = 3 r_E.

Our goal is to find r_D in the form sqrt(m) - n, then compute m + n. Let me denote r_E as t, so r_D = 3t.

We need to find t first, and then multiply by 3 to get r_D.

Let me think about circle E. Since it is tangent to AB, which is the x-axis in our coordinate system, and it’s inside circle C, its center must be somewhere above or below the x-axis. But since it's tangent to AB, the distance from its center to AB (the x-axis) must be equal to its radius. Assuming it's above the x-axis (it doesn't really matter because of symmetry, but let's pick above), the y-coordinate of its center is equal to its radius, t. Let me denote the center of circle E as (x, t).

Now, since circle E is internally tangent to circle C, the distance from center E to center O (0,0) must be equal to the difference in radii. The radius of circle C is 2, and the radius of circle E is t, so the distance between centers should be 2 - t.

Thus, the distance from (x, t) to (0,0) is sqrt(x^2 + t^2) = 2 - t. So, let's write that:

sqrt(x^2 + t^2) = 2 - t

Squaring both sides:

x^2 + t^2 = (2 - t)^2 = 4 - 4t + t^2

Subtract t^2 from both sides:

x^2 = 4 - 4t

Therefore, x^2 = 4(1 - t)

So, x = ±2√(1 - t)

But since circle E is also externally tangent to circle D. Let me think about that. Circle D has center at (2 - r_D, 0) which is (2 - 3t, 0), since r_D = 3t. Circle E has center at (x, t) and radius t. External tangency means the distance between centers is equal to the sum of the radii. So:

distance between (x, t) and (2 - 3t, 0) must be equal to r_D + r_E = 3t + t = 4t.

Hence:

sqrt[(x - (2 - 3t))^2 + (t - 0)^2] = 4t

Let me compute this:

sqrt[(x - 2 + 3t)^2 + t^2] = 4t

Square both sides:

(x - 2 + 3t)^2 + t^2 = 16 t^2

Expand the left side:

(x - 2 + 3t)^2 + t^2 = (x - 2)^2 + 6t(x - 2) + 9t^2 + t^2
= (x^2 - 4x + 4) + 6t x - 12 t + 9t^2 + t^2
= x^2 - 4x + 4 + 6t x - 12 t + 10t^2

Set equal to 16 t^2:

x^2 - 4x + 4 + 6t x - 12 t + 10t^2 = 16 t^2

Subtract 16t^2 from both sides:

x^2 - 4x + 4 + 6t x - 12t - 6t^2 = 0

Hmm, okay. Now, from the previous relation when circle E was tangent to circle C, we have x^2 = 4(1 - t). So maybe substitute x^2 into this equation.

From x^2 = 4(1 - t), so replace x^2 with 4(1 - t):

4(1 - t) - 4x + 4 + 6t x - 12t - 6t^2 = 0

Let me compute each term:

4(1 - t) = 4 - 4t

Then:

4 - 4t - 4x + 4 + 6t x - 12t - 6t^2 = 0

Combine like terms:

(4 + 4) = 8

(-4t - 12t) = -16t

(-4x + 6t x) = x(-4 + 6t)

Then -6t^2

So overall:

8 - 16t + x(-4 + 6t) - 6t^2 = 0

Now, we need to express x in terms of t or vice versa. We know that x^2 = 4(1 - t), so x = ±2√(1 - t). But the problem is that whether x is positive or negative. If we consider circle E being tangent to AB and inside circle C, depending on where it's located.

But since circle E is tangent to AB (x-axis) and also externally tangent to circle D, which is centered at (2 - 3t, 0). Let's think about whether circle E is on the left or right side of circle D. Since circle D is close to point A, which is at (2, 0), if circle D is at (2 - 3t, 0), so 2 - 3t is approaching 2 as t approaches 0. If circle E is tangent to AB and close to the center, maybe it's on the left side? Wait, but circle E is also tangent to AB, so it's located somewhere above the x-axis. Let's try to figure out if x is positive or negative.

Assuming the circle E is to the left of circle D, but given that circle D is close to point A (on the right end of diameter AB), it's possible that circle E is on the left side of circle D, so x would be less than (2 - 3t). Alternatively, maybe closer to the center. But since it's tangent to AB and on the upper half, perhaps x is positive but smaller than 2 - 3t. Wait, perhaps let me see.

Alternatively, if x is positive, then since center of E is (x, t), which is above the x-axis, and circle E is tangent to the x-axis at (x,0). But also, since circle D is at (2 - 3t, 0), distance between circle D and E must be 4t. So if x is less than 2 - 3t, then the distance between centers is (2 - 3t - x) horizontally, and t vertically. If x is greater than 2 - 3t, then it becomes (x - (2 - 3t)) horizontally. Hmm. Not sure yet. Maybe, given that circle E is tangent to AB, which is the x-axis, perhaps avoiding complex configurations. Let me check.

In the coordinate system, center of E is at (x, t). If circle E is tangent to AB (x-axis), then it's tangent at (x,0). If circle E is to the right of circle D, that is x > 2 - 3t, then perhaps the distance would be larger. But depending on values. But without knowing the exact value of t, it's hard to say. Maybe we need to consider both cases? But perhaps there is only one valid solution. Let's proceed.

From our earlier substitution, x = ±2√(1 - t). So x can be positive or negative. Let me first consider the positive case. Let’s assume x is positive. Therefore, x = 2√(1 - t). Then substituting into the equation we had:

8 - 16t + x(-4 + 6t) - 6t^2 = 0

So substitute x = 2√(1 - t):

8 - 16t + 2√(1 - t)(-4 + 6t) - 6t^2 = 0

This seems a bit messy. Alternatively, maybe using x = 2√(1 - t) and substitute into the equation. Let's try that.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a better way to approach this problem. Let's consider centers and coordinates. Since circle E is tangent to AB, the center is at (x, t), with t being its radius. It is also in the upper half-plane. Now, it's tangent to circle D, which is at (2 - 3t, 0) with radius 3t. So distance between centers:

sqrt[(x - (2 - 3t))^2 + (t - 0)^2] = 3t + t = 4t

Which we had earlier. So simplifying:

sqrt[(x - 2 + 3t)^2 + t^2] = 4t

Now square both sides:

(x - 2 + 3t)^2 + t^2 = 16t^2

Expand left side:

(x - 2 + 3t)^2 + t^2 = x^2 -4x +4 + 6tx -12t + 9t^2 + t^2 = x^2 -4x +4 +6tx -12t +10t^2

Set equal to 16t^2:

x^2 -4x +4 +6tx -12t +10t^2 = 16t^2

So moving all terms to left:

x^2 -4x +4 +6tx -12t +10t^2 -16t^2 =0

Simplify:

x^2 -4x +4 +6tx -12t -6t^2 =0

Which brings us back to the earlier equation.

Now, from the other equation from being tangent to circle C, we had x^2 + t^2 = (2 - t)^2, leading to x^2 = 4 -4t -t^2 + t^2? Wait, wait:

Wait originally:

Distance from E to O is 2 - t, so sqrt(x^2 + t^2) = 2 - t.

Therefore squaring:

x^2 + t^2 = (2 - t)^2 = 4 -4t + t^2

Subtract t^2 from both sides:

x^2 = 4 -4t

So x^2 = 4(1 - t). Therefore, x^2 = 4 -4t. So, that's where that came from. So x = ±2√(1 - t). Therefore, x^2 is 4(1 - t).

So coming back, substituting x^2 into our previous equation:

From x^2 -4x +4 +6tx -12t -6t^2 =0, replacing x^2:

4(1 - t) -4x +4 +6tx -12t -6t^2 =0

Simplify:

4 -4t -4x +4 +6tx -12t -6t^2 =0

Combine like terms:

4 +4 =8

-4t -12t= -16t

-4x +6tx= x(-4 +6t)

-6t^2= -6t^2

Therefore:

8 -16t +x(-4 +6t) -6t^2 =0

Now, since x=2√(1 - t) (assuming positive), plug in:

8 -16t + [2√(1 - t)] (-4 +6t) -6t^2 =0

Let me compute each term:

First, 8 -16t remains.

Then, the second term: 2√(1 - t) multiplied by (-4 +6t) = 2√(1 -t)(6t -4)

Third term: -6t^2

So the equation is:

8 -16t + 2√(1 - t)(6t -4) -6t^2 =0

This is looking complicated. Let me collect like terms and see if we can isolate the square root.

Let me move all non-radical terms to one side:

2√(1 - t)(6t -4) = 6t^2 +16t -8

Divide both sides by 2:

√(1 - t)(6t -4) =3t^2 +8t -4

Now, let's square both sides to eliminate the square root. However, we need to be cautious as squaring can introduce extraneous solutions.

Left side: [√(1 - t)(6t -4)]2 = (1 - t)(6t -4)2

Right side: (3t^2 +8t -4)^2

Therefore:

(1 - t)(6t -4)^2 = (3t^2 +8t -4)^2

Now expand both sides:

First, compute (6t -4)^2:

= 36t2 -48t +16

Multiply by (1 - t):

= (36t2 -48t +16)(1 - t)

=36t2(1 - t) -48t(1 - t) +16(1 - t)

=36t2 -36t3 -48t +48t2 +16 -16t

Combine like terms:

-36t3 + (36t2 +48t2) + (-48t -16t) +16

= -36t3 +84t2 -64t +16

Now expand the right side: (3t2 +8t -4)^2

Let me compute that:

= (3t2)^2 + (8t)^2 + (-4)^2 + 2*(3t2)(8t) + 2*(3t2)*(-4) + 2*(8t)*(-4)

=9t^4 +64t^2 +16 +48t^3 -24t^2 -64t

Combine like terms:

=9t^4 +48t^3 + (64t2 -24t2) + (-64t) +16

=9t^4 +48t^3 +40t2 -64t +16

So now, set the left and right sides equal:

-36t3 +84t2 -64t +16 = 9t^4 +48t^3 +40t2 -64t +16

Subtract left side from both sides:

0 =9t^4 +48t^3 +40t2 -64t +16 +36t3 -84t2 +64t -16

Simplify:

9t^4 +48t3 +36t3 +40t2 -84t2 + (-64t +64t) +16 -16

Calculations term by term:

9t^4

48t3 +36t3=84t3

40t2 -84t2= -44t2

-64t +64t=0

16 -16=0

Thus, 0=9t^4 +84t3 -44t2

Factor out t2:

0= t2(9t2 +84t -44)

Therefore, either t2=0 ⇒t=0, which is not possible as radius can’t be zero,

or 9t2 +84t -44=0

Solve this quadratic in terms of t:

9t2 +84t -44 =0

Use quadratic formula:

t = [-84 ± sqrt(842 -4*9*(-44))]/(2*9)

Compute discriminant:

D= 842 -4*9*(-44)

=7056 + 1584

=7056 +1584

Let me compute:

7056 + 1000=8056

8056 +584=8640

Thus sqrt(8640)

Simplify sqrt(8640):

sqrt(8640)=sqrt(16*540)=4*sqrt(540)=4*sqrt(36*15)=4*6*sqrt(15)=24sqrt(15)

Wait, but check:

Wait 84^2=7056, 4*9*44=36*44=1584

So D=7056 +1584=8640

Break down 8640:

8640= 100*86.4= but perhaps factor it:

Divide by 16:8640 ÷16=540, which is same as before.

Yes, as above, sqrt(8640)=sqrt(16*540)=4*sqrt(540)=sqrt(540)=sqrt(36*15)=6sqrt(15). So 4*6sqrt(15)=24sqrt(15). So sqrt(8640)=24sqrt(15)

So:

t = [-84 ±24√15]/18

Simplify fractions:

Factor numerator and denominator:

-84 = -12*7, 24=12*2, 18=6*3. Wait, maybe divide numerator and denominator by 6:

[-84 ±24√15]/18 = [-14 ±4√15]/3

Hence,

t = [ -14 ±4√15 ] /3

But since t is the radius of circle E, it must be positive. Therefore, only consider the positive root:

t = [ -14 +4√15 ] /3 ≈ [ -14 + 4*3.872 ] /3≈(-14 +15.488)/3≈1.488/3≈0.496, which is positive. The other root would be negative, so we discard it.

So t= (-14 +4√15)/3

But radius of D is three times radius of E, so

r_D=3t= -14 +4√15=4√15 -14

Wait, 3t=3*[ (-14 +4√15 ) /3 ]= -14 +4√15.

Yes, simplifies nicely. So 4√15 -14.

But the problem states that r_D can be written in the form sqrt(m)-n. Wait, 4√15 is equal to sqrt(16*15)=sqrt(240). So,

r_D = sqrt(240) -14. Hence, m=240, n=14. Then m +n=254.

Wait, but is that correct? Wait, 4√15 is 4 times the square root of 15. But sqrt(240) is sqrt(16*15)=4sqrt(15). So, indeed, 4sqrt(15)=sqrt(240). So, sqrt(240)-14 is equivalent to 4sqrt(15)-14; therefore, the form is sqrt(240)-14, so m=240 and n=14, so m +n=254. So the answer is 254.

Wait, but let's check whether the problem says "can be written in the form sqrt(m)-n". Is 4sqrt(15)-14 in the form sqrt(m)-n? Hmm, if it's required that it's a single square root, then sqrt(240) is 4sqrt(15), so yes, it could be written as sqrt(240)-14, even though 240 is 16*15, but m and n are positive integers, which they are.

Thus then m=240 and n=14, so m+n=254.

But I should check whether I made any miscalculations. Let me verify each step to be sure.

Starting from the quadratic equation, after expanding both sides, we ended up with:

9t^4 +84t3 -44t2=0

Factor out t2: t2(9t2 +84t -44)=0. Thus non-zero solutions come from 9t2 +84t -44=0. Quadratic formula: t=(-84 ±sqrt(842 +4*9*44))/18. Wait wait, hold on a sec. In the quadratic equation, for at2 + bt +c=0 solutions are (-b ±sqrt(b2 -4ac))/2a. Wait the equation is 9t2 +84t -44=0. So:

t= [ -84 ±sqrt(842 -4*9*(-44)) ]/(2*9)=[ -84 ±sqrt(7056 + 1584) ]/18= [ -84 ±sqrt(8640) ]/18.

Then sqrt(8640)=sqrt(144*60)=12sqrt(60). Similarly, 60=4*15, sqrt(60)=2sqrt(15), so sqrt(8640)=12*2*sqrt(15)=24sqrt(15). Thus:

t= [ -84 ±24sqrt(15) ]/18. Then, dividing numerator and denominator by 6:

t= [ -14 ±4sqrt(15) ]/3.

Since t must be positive, t=( -14 +4sqrt(15) )/3.

Multiply numerator and denominator by 1: t=(4sqrt(15) -14)/3. Then, radius D is 3t=4sqrt(15)-14. Then, 4sqrt(15) is sqrt( (4)^2 *15 )=sqrt(16*15)=sqrt(240). So sqrt(240)-14 is the radius D. Therefore, m=240, n=14. Thus m +n=254.

But let me verify if r_D=4√15 -14 actually makes sense.

Check if 4√15 ≈4*3.872≈15.488. Thus, 15.488 -14≈1.488. And for radius of E, r_E=(4√15 -14)/3≈(15.488 -14)/3≈1.488/3≈0.496.

So checking dimensions:

Circle D: radius ≈1.488, centered at (2 - 3t, 0)=(2 -3*0.496, 0)=2 -1.488≈0.512. So center at (0.512, 0), radius≈1.488, hence, the distance from O (0,0) to D (0.512,0) is≈0.512, and 2 - r_D≈2 -1.488≈0.512. Correct. And distance from D to A (2,0) is |-0.512 +2|=1.488≈ r_D. So correct.

Circle E: center at (x, t) where x=±2√(1 - t). Let's compute t≈0.496. Then 1 - t≈0.504. √(0.504)=≈0.71. Therefore, x≈2*0.71≈1.42. So center at (1.42,0.496). Check distance from E to O: sqrt(1.422 +0.4962)≈sqrt(2.0164 +0.246)=sqrt(2.2624)=≈1.504. While 2 - t≈2 -0.496≈1.504. Correct.

Distance from circle E to circle D: circle D at (0.512,0) and circle E at (1.42,0.496) distance≈sqrt( (1.42 -0.512)^2 + (0.496 -0)^2 )≈sqrt(0.9082 +0.4962 )≈sqrt(0.824 +0.246)=sqrt(1.070)=≈1.035. While r_D +r_E=1.488 +0.496≈1.984. Wait, that discrepancy is an issue. They should be externally tangent, distance between centers should be 4t ≈4*(0.496)=1.984. Wait, but I got approximately 1.035. That’s inconsistent. Wait, what did I do wrong here?

Oh, something went wrong in my approximation. Let's do the precise calculation:

Wait in terms of t= (4√15 -14)/3.

So t≈(4*3.872 -14)/3≈(15.488 -14)/3≈1.488/3≈0.496.

x=2√(1 - t)=2*√(1 -0.496)=2*√(0.504)=2*≈0.71≈1.42.

Center of D is at (2 - 3t,0)=2 -3*0.496≈0.512.

So distance between center E (1.42,0.496) and D (0.512,0):

distance= sqrt( (1.42 -0.512)^2 + (0.496 -0)^2 )

Calculate the differences:

1.42 -0.512=0.908

0.496 -0=0.496

Square and add:

0.9082≈0.824

0.4962≈0.246

Total≈0.824 +0.246=1.070

Square root≈1.034

But according to our earlier calculation, the distance should be 4t≈4*0.496≈1.984.

But the actual distance here computes to ≈1.034, which isn't 1.984. There's a mistake here.

Uh-oh, that's a problem. That suggests an error in the solution. Where did I go wrong?

Hold on, let's think. When we squared both sides of the equation, maybe we introduced an extraneous solution, or perhaps made an algebraic mistake. Alternatively, my mistake could be in the coordinate setup. Let me check.

Wait, circle D is at (2 - 3t,0). Wait, original definition says circle D's radius is three times of circle E's. But circle D was set to have radius 3t, where t=radius of E. Therefore, center of D is at (2 - 3t, 0).

But when solving the equations, we derived t=(4√15 -14)/3≈(15.488 -14)/3≈0.496, so 3t≈1.488, so center D is at 2 - 3t≈2 -1.488≈0.512. Which is correct.

Then center of E is at (x, t), where x=±2√(1 -t). With t≈0.496, sqrt(1 - t)=sqrt(0.504)≈0.71, so x≈1.42. So center of E is at (1.42,0.496). Then, check the distance to center D:

sqrt( (1.42 -0.512)^2 +0.4962 )≈sqrt(0.908^2 +0.496^2)≈sqrt(0.824 +0.246)=sqrt(1.07)=≈1.035, which is not equal to 4t≈1.984. That discrepancy indicates a problem. Where is the mistake?

Wait, let's go back. The equation for the distance between centers E and D was supposed to be 4t. But according to calculations here, coordinates lead to distance≈1.035, which is not 4t. Therefore, something's wrong in our algebra.

Starting back from quadratic equation:

Wait after squaring both sides, [sqrt(...)] =4t.

But when we squared, perhaps I made an error in expansion.

Wait let's verify expanding [sqrt[(x - (2 - 3t))^2 + t^2]] =4t. When we square both sides, we get (x -2 +3t)^2 +t^2=16t2. So expand (x -2 +3t)^2 +t^2:

=(x2 -4x +4 +6t x -12t +9t2)+t2= x2 -4x +4 +6t x -12t +10t2. Hence  x2 -4x +4 +6t x -12t +10t2=16t2. So equation is x2 -4x +4 +6t x -12t -6t2=0. Which we have.

Then use x2=4(1-t) replace into equation:

4(1-t)-4x +4 +6t x -12t -6t2=0. Then 4-4t -4x +4 +6t x -12t -6t2=0. Combine like terms:8 -16t -4x +6t x -6t2=0. Which as before. Multiply terms if x=2√(1-t). But if the issue is due to the assumption that x is positive.

Wait, perhaps x is negative. Let's check x=-2√(1-t). Maybe the actual center is on the other side of the center. Suppose x=-2√(1 -t). So center at (-2√(1-t), t). Let's compute in that case. Then the distance to D, which is at (2 -3t,0). So computing in that case:

sqrt( [ -2√(1 -t) - (2 - 3t) ]^2 + t^2 )

= sqrt( [-2√(1 -t) -2 +3t]^2 +t^2 )

But this seems even more complicated, but let's compute:

Suppose t≈0.496.

Then, 1 -t≈0.504, sqrt≈0.71. So x=-2*0.71≈-1.42.

Center of E is (-1.42,0.496). Distance to center D (0.512,0):

sqrt( (-1.42 -0.512)^2 +0.496^2 )≈sqrt(-1.9322 +0.246)=sqrt(3.734 +0.246)=sqrt(3.98)≈1.995≈4*0.496≈1.984≈ which is close.

Hmm, there's a rounding error here.

More precise:

t=(4√15 -14)/3≈(4*3.872983346 -14)/3≈(15.49193338 -14)/3≈1.49193338/3≈0.497311127

So t≈0.4973

Thus 1 - t≈0.5027, sqrt(1-t)≈sqrt(0.5027)≈0.709.

Thus x=-2*0.709≈-1.418

Center D: 2 -3t≈2 -3*0.4973≈2 -1.4919≈0.5081

So distance between centers:

sqrt( [(-1.418 -0.5081)^2 + (0.4973)^2 ] )

Compute:

difference in x: -1.418 -0.5081≈-1.9261

Difference in y:0.4973 -0=0.4973

So distance squared: (-1.9261)^2 + (0.4973)^2≈3.709 +0.247≈3.956

Square root≈1.989, which is≈4t=4*0.4973≈1.9892.

That matches exactly. Therefore, my mistake earlier was assuming x positive. But clearly, circle E's center is at x negative. Hence, we need to take x negative. Therefore, in our previous steps, in x=±2√(1 -t), we need to pick the negative root.

Therefore, important to get x= -2√(1 -t).

Therefore, in our quadratic substitution step, substituting x= -2√(1 -t). Let's correct this.

So back to equation:

8 -16t +x(-4 +6t) -6t2=0

With x=-2√(1 -t). So plug that in:

8 -16t +(-2√(1 -t))*(-4 +6t) -6t2=0

Multiply:

(-2√(1 -t))*(-4 +6t)=8√(1 -t)-12t√(1 -t)

So the equation becomes:

8 -16t +8√(1 -t)-12t√(1 -t) -6t2=0

Again, this is complicated, but when we did squared both sides earlier, got to t=(4√15 -14)/3, but plugging into coordinate with x negative solved the distance problem.

Therefore, it's correct: even if substitution steps the equations, the solution satisfies.

So this confirms that t=(4√15 -14)/3, so r_D=4√15 -14, and written in sqrt(m) -n as sqrt(240)-14, m=240,n=14,answer 254.

But just to recap why this works:

Because taking x negative gives us the correct distance between centers E and D. If we take x positive, we get the wrong distance, so the correct solution comes from x negative, hence x=-2√(1-t). The quadratic had two roots, t=( -14±4√15 )/3, one positive and one negative, and we'd take the positive t≈0.4973.

Therefore, everything checks out.

Thus, the final answer is \boxed{254}.
