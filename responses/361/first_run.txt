Okay, let me start by understanding the problem again to ensure I don't miss any details. We have three circles: C, D, and E. Circle C has radius 2 and diameter AB. Circle D is internally tangent to C at point A, and Circle E is internally tangent to C, externally tangent to D, and tangent to AB. The radius of D is three times that of E, and we need to find the sum m + n where D's radius is expressed as sqrt(m) - n.

First, I'll set up a coordinate system with Circle C's center at the origin (0,0), so AB extends from (-2,0) to (2,0). Circle D is tangent to C at A (2,0), so its center lies along the x-axis. Let the radius of D be r_D and E be r_E, with r_D = 3r_E. The center of D is at (2 - r_D, 0) because the distance between C's center (0,0) and D's center must be 2 - r_D (since they're internally tangent).

Next, Circle E is tangent to AB, so its center must be (x, r_E) where x can be ±2√(1 - r_E) derived from the distance condition to C's center. Circle E is externally tangent to D, so the distance between their centers (sqrt((x - (2 - 3r_E))² + r_E²)) must equal r_D + r_E = 4r_E.

Substituting x = -2√(1 - r_E) (negative because of the tangent direction), we solve the quadratic equation resulting from squaring the distance condition. This leads to r_E = (4√15 - 14)/3 and thus r_D = 4√15 - 14, which fits the form sqrt(240) - 14. Hence, m = 240 and n = 14, giving m + n = 254.
