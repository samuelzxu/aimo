Okay, let me try to figure out which tokens are essential for future reasoning steps based on the provided problem and solution. The problem involves a recursive function f and classifying numbers into three sets based on f(n) compared to f(n+1). Then, finding a maximum value formula.

First, the initial computations for small n (0 to 15) are crucial. These show patterns in f(n) and help identify the behavior needed for sets L, E, G. The key observations here include f(n) being zero for powers of two and the recursive definitions for even and odd n.

The detailed derivation for set L, E, G relies on analyzing whether n is even or odd. Even numbers (except zero) fall into L because their difference m is positive. For odd numbers, the distinction between 1 mod 4 and 3 mod 4 determines E and G. This modular analysis is critical.

For part (b), the pattern in maximum values a_k relates to numbers of the form 2^k -1. The recurrence relation for f(2^k -1) and solving it using linear recurrence is essential. The final formula involves a recursive relationship and derived coefficients, which are key steps.

The critical sentences and formulas that must be retained include:

1. Computed values of f(n) from n=0 to n=15. This data set is necessary to observe patterns.
2. Observations about f(n) being zero at powers of two and the recursive definitions.
3. The key formulas derived for f(n) in terms of binary expansions and recursion.
4. Analysis of differences for even and odd n leading to sets L, E, G.
5. The recurrence relation for b_k = f(2^k -1) and its solution leading to the formula for a_k.
6. Final definitions of sets L, E, G based on parity and modular conditions.
7. The explicit formula for a_k combining terms from the recurrence solution.

Each of these elements supports the conclusions and must be kept to validate the steps taken, especially for someone reviewing the reasoning or continuing from where this solution left off.
