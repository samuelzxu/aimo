Okay, let's work through this problem step by step. The task is to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where 1 ≤ a ≤ 100 and b ≥ 0, such that the polynomial x² + ax + b can be factored into two linear factors with integer coefficients. Then, we need to find the remainder when this number, S, is divided by 1000.

First, let's understand the factoring condition. If the polynomial factors into (x + m)(x + n) where m and n are integers, then expanding gives:
x² + (m + n)x + mn.
Comparing coefficients, we have a = m + n and b = mn. Both m and n must be non-negative integers because if they were negative, their sum a would be negative, which contradicts a being at least 1.

For each a, we need to count the distinct values of b = mn where m and n are non-negative integers such that m + n = a. The number of distinct b values for a given a is determined by the products of pairs (m, a - m) as m ranges from 0 to a.

By analyzing examples and patterns, we observe that the number of distinct values of b for a given a is floor(a/2) + 1. This is because the products form a symmetric sequence around m = a/2, leading to unique values up to the midpoint.

Summing this expression for all a from 1 to 100:
- For even a = 2k, the number of distinct b is k + 1.
- For odd a = 2k + 1, the number of distinct b is k + 1.

Summing floor(a/2) + 1 from a = 1 to 100 involves pairing terms:
Sum = Σ_{k=1}^{50} [k + (k + 1)] = Σ_{k=1}^{50} (2k + 1) = 2 * Σ_{k=1}^{50} k + 50 = 2*(50*51/2) + 50 = 2550 + 50 = 2600.

Finally, the remainder when 2600 is divided by 1000 is 600.

- Paragraph 7, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, the number of distinct products would be k + 1 (from m=0 to m=k), because from m=0 to m=k, the products are 0, 2k - 1, ..., k2. However, some of these values might repeat.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, for each a, the number of distinct b's is the number of distinct products m(a - m) as m ranges from 0 to a.</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, the strategy is: 1. For each a from 1 to 100: a. Compute the set B_a = {m(a - m) | m ∈ N, 0 ≤ m ≤ a}. b. Find the number of distinct elements in B_a, which is |B_a|. 2. Sum all |B_a| over a = 1 to 100 to get S. 3. Compute S mod 1000.</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, the formula seems correct. Therefore, for each a, |B_a|=floor(a/2) +1.</keep>

- Paragraph 12, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, the total Sum S is Sum_{a=1 to 100}(floor(a/2)+1). Which through processing becomes Sum_{k=1 to50}(2k +1)=2600.</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, computing S as Sum_{a=1}^{100} (floor(a/2) +1) gives 2600.</keep>
- Paragraph 14, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, 2600 mod 1000=2600-2*1000=600.</keep>
- Paragraph 15, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, the answer is 600.</keep>
