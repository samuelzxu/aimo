Okay, let's try to figure out which parts of the reasoning are essential to keep for future steps. The problem involves a cube and finding the distance from a vertex to a plane, given the heights of adjacent vertices. The solution involves setting up equations based on the normal vector of the plane and solving a quadratic equation.

First, the key steps are identifying the equations derived from the heights of the adjacent vertices and setting up the quadratic equation. The critical part is where the equations for u, v, w are substituted into the unit vector condition. The expansion of the quadratic terms and solving the quadratic equation are essential, as they lead directly to the final expression for h.

So, looking at the thinking trajectory, the key paragraphs are where they set up the equations for u, v, w in terms of h and then substitute into the unit normal vector equation. Then, expanding the quadratic equation and solving it with the quadratic formula is crucial. The final steps of simplifying the roots and determining which solution is valid (since h must be less than 10) are also important.

Additionally, the part where they convert the solution into the form (r - sqrt(s))/t and identify r, s, t is necessary for the final answer. Each of these steps needs to be retained because they build upon each other to reach the conclusion. Missing any of these steps might leave gaps in understanding how the variables relate or how the final answer was computed.

The derivation of the quadratic equation from the sum of squares and the subsequent solving process are the backbone of the solution. The simplification of the square root of 1176 into 14√6 is a key mathematical step that needs to be kept for clarity. Also, verifying the feasible solution by considering the physical constraint (h < 10) ensures correctness.

Lastly, expressing the solution in the required format and calculating r + s + t are final but essential steps. These parts all contribute to the logical flow leading to the boxed answer.
