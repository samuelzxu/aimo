Okay, let me start by understanding the problem. We have three vectors a, b, and c with norms 1, 1, and 2 respectively. We need to find the maximum value of the sum of the squares of their differences: ||a - 2b||² + ||b - 2c||² + ||c - 2a||².

First, I remember that expanding the squared norm of a vector difference involves using the formula ||x - y||² = ||x||² + ||y||² - 2x·y. Applying this to each term in the expression:

1. Expand ||a - 2b||²:
   - ||a||² is 1.
   - ||2b||² is 4||b||² = 4*1 = 4.
   - The dot product term is -2*(a·2b) = -4a·b.
   - So, total is 1 + 4 - 4a·b = 5 - 4a·b.

2. Expand ||b - 2c||²:
   - ||b||² is 1.
   - ||2c||² is 4*4 = 16 (since ||c||=2).
   - The dot product term is -2*(b·2c) = -4b·c.
   - Total becomes 1 + 16 - 4b·c = 17 - 4b·c.

3. Expand ||c - 2a||²:
   - ||c||² is 4.
   - ||2a||² is 4*1 = 4.
   - The dot product term is -2*(c·2a) = -4c·a.
   - Summing up, 4 + 4 - 4c·a = 8 - 4c·a.

Adding all three terms together:
5 - 4a·b + 17 - 4b·c + 8 - 4c·a = 30 - 4(a·b + b·c + c·a).

To maximize this expression, we need to minimize the sum S = a·b + b·c + c·a. 

Considering the dot products in terms of angles:
- a·b = cosθ_ab
- b·c = 2cosθ_bc
- c·a = 2cosθ_ca

So S = cosθ_ab + 2cosθ_bc + 2cosθ_ca. To minimize S, we need these angles to be such that the cosines are as negative as possible. 

Through analysis using Lagrange multipliers and considering vector configurations, the minimal value of S occurs when vectors a and b are aligned, and c is their negative sum, leading to S = -3. Plugging this back, the maximum value of the original expression is 30 - 4*(-3) = 42.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 1: <keep>First, I recall that the squared norm of a vector difference can be expanded using the formula \|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}\|^2 = \|\mathbf{x}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{y}\|^2 - 2\mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{y}.</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 5: <keep>Applying the formula, that would be \|\mathbf{a}\|^2 + (2)^2\|\mathbf{b}\|^2 - 2 \times \mathbf{a} \cdot (2\mathbf{b}).</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 8: <keep>1^2 + 4 \times 1^2 - 2 \times 2 \times (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}) = 1 + 4 - 4(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}) = 5 - 4\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 2: <keep>Again, using the formula, that's \|\mathbf{b}\|^2 + (2)^2\|\mathbf{c}\|^2 - 2 \times \mathbf{b} \cdot (2\mathbf{c}).</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 5: <keep>1 + 4 \times 4 - 4(\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c}) = 1 + 16 - 4(\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c}) = 17 - 4\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c}.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 2: <keep>Expand that to \|\mathbf{c}\|^2 + (2)^2\|\mathbf{a}\|^2 - 2 \times \mathbf{c} \cdot (2\mathbf{a}).</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 5: <keep>4 + 4 \times 1 - 4(\mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a}) = 4 + 4 - 4(\mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a}) = 8 - 4\mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a}.</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 1: <keep>Now, putting all three expanded terms together, the entire expression becomes:</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 4: <keep>Then, the terms with the dot products: -4\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} -4\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} -4\mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a}.</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 6: <keep>Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 30 - 4(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a}).</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 1: <keep>So, to maximize the original expression, we need to minimize the sum of the dot products: \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a}.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 2: <keep>Thus, the dot product terms can be expressed in terms of angles:</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 3: <keep>\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = (1)(1) \cos \theta_{ab} = \cos \theta_{ab}</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 4: <keep>\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} = (1)(2) \cos \theta_{bc} = 2 \cos \theta_{bc}</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 5: <keep>\mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a} = (2)(1) \cos \theta_{ca} = 2 \cos \theta_{ca}</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 6: <keep>So, S = \cos \theta_{ab} + 2 \cos \theta_{bc} + 2 \cos \theta_{ca</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 2: <keep>Set up Lagrangian:</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 4: <keep>L = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a} + λ1(1 - ||a||^2) + λ2(1 - ||b||^2) + λ3(4 - ||c||^2).</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 3: <keep>Gradient of L w.r.to a is: derivative of (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a}) + derivative of (- λ1 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a})</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 4: <keep>So that's \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c} - 2λ1 \mathbf{a} = 0.</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 7: <keep>\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{c} - 2λ2 \mathbf{b} = 0.</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 10: <keep>\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} - 2λ3 \mathbf{c} = 0.</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 1: <keep>From equation 3: \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} = 2λ3 \mathbf{c}</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 2: <keep>Therefore, \mathbf{c} = (\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}) / (2λ3).</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 5: <keep>Multiply both sides by 2λ3 to eliminate denominator:</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 7: <keep>\mathbf{a} + (2λ3 + 1)\mathbf{b} = 4λ1 λ3 \mathbf{a}</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 10: <keep>\mathbf{a}(1 - 4λ1 λ3) + \mathbf{b}(2λ3 + 1) = 0</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 13: <keep>From the second equation: 2λ3 + 1 = 0 ⇒ λ3 = -1/2.</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 14: <keep>1 - 4λ1 (-1/2) = 0 → 1 + 2λ1 = 0 → λ1 = -1/2.</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentence 3: <keep>Equation 2 becomes: \mathbf{a} + (-\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}) = 2λ2 \mathbf{b}</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentence 5: <keep>-\mathbf{b} = 2λ2 \mathbf{b}, which implies -1 = 2λ2, hence λ2 = -1/2.</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 1: <keep>From equation 3: \mathbf{c} = (\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b})/(2λ3) = (\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b})/(2*(-1/2)) = (\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}) / (-1) = -\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 5: <keep>Compute ||c||2 = || -a - b ||2 = ||a + b||2 = ||a||2 + ||b||2 + 2\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}.</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 8: <keep>2 + 2x = 4 => 2x = 2 => x = 1.</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 10: <keep>So, if \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} =1, then vectors a and b are parallel.</keep>
- Paragraph 14, Sentence 1: <keep>S = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a}:</keep>
- Paragraph 14, Sentence 4: <keep>=1 + (-2(a ⋅ a)) + (-2*1) =1 -2 -2= -3.</keep>
- Paragraph 14, Sentence 7: <keep>Original expression: \|\mathbf{a} - 2 \mathbf{b}\|2 + \|\mathbf{b} - 2 \mathbf{c}\|2 + \|\mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a}\|2.</keep>
- Paragraph 14, Sentence 13: <keep>Sum:1 +25 +16=42.</keep>
- Paragraph 15, Sentence 2: <keep>Therefore, the problem reduces to minimizing S = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a}.</keep>
- Paragraph 16, Sentence 4: <keep>Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} ≥ -||\mathbf{a}|| ||\mathbf{b}||), but since S is a sum of three terms, maybe use various inequalities.</keep>
- Paragraph 16, Sentence 6: <keep>Compute ||a + b + c||2 = ||a||2 + ||b||2 + ||c||2 + 2(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{c})</keep>
- Paragraph 16, Sentence 9: <keep>Thus, K = ||a + b + c||2 =6 +2S. Then S = (K -6)/2.</keep>
- Paragraph 16, Sentence 11: <keep>So since norms are non-negative, the smallest possible ||a + b + c||2 is zero.</keep>
- Paragraph 16, Sentence 13: <keep>sqrt(2 + 2x) =2, where x = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}.</keep>
- Paragraph 16, Sentence 15: <keep>Thus, 2 + 2x =4 ⇒ x=1, which implies \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}=1, so a and b are colinear.</keep>
- Paragraph 16, Sentence 17: <keep>Hence, S= (0 -6)/2= -3.</keep>
- Paragraph 17, Sentence 1: <keep>Thus, the minimal possible S is -3, corresponding to K=||a + b + c||2=0, leading to S=(0-6)/2=-3.</keep>
- Paragraph 17, Sentence 3: <keep>Therefore, the overall minimal value of S is -3, and thus maximal value of the original expression is 30 -4*(-3)=30+12=42.</keep>
