Okay, let me figure out which parts of the reasoning are essential for determining the minimum value. The key steps involve substituting variables, applying AM-GM inequality, using Lagrangian multipliers, and verifying with specific numerical examples. The most critical parts are where the substitution of variables leads to simplifying the expression, the application of AM-GM, and the specific cases where variables are set equal or different, resulting in the final answer of 2√2. 

Looking at the trajectory:

1. The initial problem understanding and expression simplification are important but might not all be essential. However, the breakdown of the expression into terms (x y²/z³ + x z/y² + y² z/x³) is crucial.

2. The substitution using a, b, c and the transformation into terms of a, b, c is part of the exploration but might not be necessary for the final steps.

3. The symmetry check where x=y=z=3^{1/4} leading to S=3 is a key step that shows the initial approach.

4. The realization that setting x=z and recalculating leads to a lower value (2.828) is critical. The detailed substitution here, including the AM-GM application, is essential.

5. The Lagrangian multiplier method confirms the critical points, but the setup and equations are quite involved. However, the conclusion that x=z and deriving y in terms of x is vital.

6. Numerical verification with x=z=√2 and y=2^{1/4} leading to S=2√2 is crucial for confirming the answer.

Essential parts to retain include the simplified expression terms, the substitution leading to 2√2, the AM-GM application resulting in equality conditions, and the specific variable values verifying the minimal value. The final answer must include the verification steps and the key substitutions showing how 2√2 is obtained.
