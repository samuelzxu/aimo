Okay, let's see. The user wants me to identify which parts of the existing reasoning are essential for future steps. The task was about finding the number of roots of unity that are roots of a quadratic equation with integer coefficients. 

First, I remember that the key idea here is the connection between roots of unity and their minimal polynomials over the rationals. The user correctly pointed out that for a root of unity to be a root of a quadratic with integer coefficients, its minimal polynomial (cyclotomic polynomial) must have degree ≤ 2. The degree of the cyclotomic polynomial is Euler's totient function φ(n). So, the critical step was determining all n where φ(n) ≤ 2.

The user then listed values of φ(n) for n from 1 upwards and found that n=1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 are the only ones with φ(n) ≤ 2. That's crucial because these correspond to the roots of unity that can be roots of such quadratics. Each of these n values gives a set of roots: n=1 gives 1 root, n=2 gives 1 root, n=3 gives 2 roots, n=4 gives 2 roots, and n=6 gives 2 roots, totaling 8.

The essential parts here are the explanations that φ(n) ≤ 2 leads to n being 1,2,3,4,6, the calculation of φ(n) for these values, and the count of roots for each n. These steps are necessary because without them, the reasoning might not justify why only those n are considered or how the total count comes to 8. 

I need to make sure that the kept sections include the logic about the cyclotomic polynomial's degree, the totient function values for specific n, the enumeration of possible n, and the count of roots per n. These are the foundational steps that lead to the conclusion. Other parts, like the example equations for specific roots, are illustrative but perhaps redundant once the main points about φ(n) and the count are established. However, the final count of 8 must be included to show the conclusion.

Wait, the user mentioned to include at least 16 blocks, but here maybe I can break down each essential step into separate blocks. For example, mentioning φ(n) ≤ 2, the values of φ(n) for each n, the list of n's that satisfy the condition, and the root count per n. Each of these could be separate kept sections. Also, including the conclusion that the total is 8. Let me check the original text again.

Looking back: The reasoning discusses cyclotomic polynomials, φ(n), calculating φ(n) for n up to 12, deducing possible n's, listing n=1,2,3,4,6, counting roots for each n, and verifying they don't overlap. Each of these steps is critical. So each of these points should be marked. Also, the final conclusion of 8 must be kept.

So, essential parts are:

- The connection between φ(n) and minimal polynomial degree.
- The list of n where φ(n) ≤ 2 (1,2,3,4,6).
- The count of roots for each n.
- The summation to total 8.

Each of these sections in the original text should be wrapped with keep tags.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 4: <keep>Therefore, if such a root is a root of a quadratic with integer coefficients, its minimal polynomial must be of degree 1 or 2. Therefore, \( \phi(n) \leq 2 \).</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 5: <keep>Hence, we must find all integers \( n \geq 1 \) such that \( \phi(n) \leq 2 \), because those roots of unity which correspond to these \( n \) will have minimal polynomials of degree at most 2, hence can be roots of a quadratic (or linear) polynomial with integer coefficients.</keep>
