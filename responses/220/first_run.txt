Alright, let's go through the provided reasoning to identify which tokens are essential for future reasoning steps. The goal is to mark these tokens with <keep> tags to optimize context usage.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The user needs to calculate the projected physical separation \( r_p \) and then use \( \theta = 125^\circ \) to estimate the time since the quasar was active. The key here is linking the calculation of \( r_p \) from part e to the trigonometric relationship in part g.

2. **Trigonometric Relationship**: The explanation establishes that the actual separation \( r = \frac{r_p}{\sin \theta} \). This formula is crucial as it connects the projected separation to the angle, making it essential to retain.

3. **Light Travel Time**: The derivation of the time \( t = \frac{r}{c} = \frac{r_p}{c \sin \theta} \) is the core of the solution. Retaining the steps showing how the time is derived from the separation is necessary for future steps.

4. **Numerical Substitution**: Mentioning \( \sin 125^\circ \approx 0.819 \) is important because it converts the trigonometric function into a numerical value, which is essential for the final calculation.

5. **Final Formula**: The boxed final answer \( \boxed{\dfrac{r_p}{0.819c}} \) must be retained as it presents the solution succinctly.

Now, let's identify the specific sentences and phrases that contain these essential tokens.

- Paragraph 1, Sentence 2: <keep>Calculate the projected physical separation, $r_{p}$, between the galaxy and the Voorwerp.g. High precision measurements showed that the Voorwerp is slightly further away than the galaxy, and so $\theta=125^{\circ}$.</keep>
  
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 3: <keep>The projected separation can be calculated if we know the distance to the objects, usually using the formula:
  \[ r_p = d * \tan(\theta) \]</keep>

- Paragraph 5, Sentence 2: <keep>the angle $\theta=125$ degrees refers to the angle between the line connecting the galaxy and the Voorwerp and our line of sight</keep>

- Paragraph 6, Sentences 3-4: <keep>the projected separation $r_p$ is $r * \sin(\theta)$, and the radial separation is $r * \cos(\theta)$. Hence, if we know the projected separation (from part e), and the angle $\theta$, then the actual separation is $r = r_p / \sin(\theta)$.</keep>

- Paragraph 7, Sentence 1: <keep>the light travel time would be the distance divided by the speed of light. So the maximum time since the quasar was active would be if the separation were entirely along the line of sight</keep>

- Paragraph 10, Sentence 1: <keep>If $\theta$ is the angle with respect to the line of sight, then if they are directly along the line of sight, $\theta$ would be 0 degrees, and the separation would be all radial.</keep>

- Paragraph 11, Sentence 3: <keep>the actual separation $r = r_p / \sin(125^\circ)$</keep>

- Paragraph 12, Sentences 2-3: <keep>the light travel time would be $t = r / c = r_p / (c * \sin(125^\circ))$. Since $\theta=125^\circ$, $\sin(125^\circ) \approx 0.819$, so $t \approx 1.22 r_p / c$.</keep>

- Paragraph 13, Sentence 1: <keep>the time since the quasar was active is the light travel time between the galaxy and the Voorwerp</keep>

- Paragraph 16, Sentence 1: <keep>Given $\theta = 125^\circ$, we substitute this value:
  \[ t = \frac{r_p}{c \sin 125^\circ} \]</keep>

- Paragraph 17, Sentences 1-2: <keep>Using $\sin 125^\circ \approx 0.819$, the upper limit for the time since the quasar was last active is:
  \[ \boxed{\dfrac{r_p}{0.819c}} \]</keep>

- Paragraph 6, Sentence 5: <keep>the actual separation is $r = r_p / \sin(\theta)$. Then, the light travel time would be the distance between G and V divided by the speed of light, so $t = r / c = r_p / (c * \sin(\theta))$.</keep>

- Paragraph 8, Sentence 1: <keep>the projected separation $r_p$ is the component of GV perpendicular to our line of sight.</keep>

- Paragraph 9, Sentence 1: <keep>the light travel time $t = r / c = (r_p / \sin(\theta)) / c$</keep>

- Paragraph 14, Sentence 1: <keep>the answer would be $t = r_p / (0.819c)$</keep>

- Paragraph 15, Sentence 1: <keep>the time since the quasar was last active is approximately $\boxed{\dfrac{r_p}{0.819c}}$ years.</keep>
