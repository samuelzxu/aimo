Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question asks for the limit of the double integral \( I(R) \) as \( R \) approaches infinity. The integral is given by:

\[
I(R) = \iint_{x^2 + y^2 \leq R^2} \left( \frac{1 + 2x^2}{1 + x^4 + 6x^2y^2 + y^4} - \frac{1 + y^2}{2 + x^4 + y^4} \right) dx \, dy
\]

First, I need to analyze the integrand and see if there's any symmetry or substitution that can simplify the expression. The denominators in both terms of the integrand look complex. Let's examine them.

For the first term, the denominator is \( 1 + x^4 + 6x^2y^2 + y^4 \). Notice that this can be rewritten as \( 1 + (x^2 + y^2)^2 + 4x^2y^2 \), which doesn't immediately suggest a factorization. The second term's denominator is \( 2 + x^4 + y^4 \), which seems simpler but not directly related to the first denominator.

Switching to polar coordinates \( x = r\cos\theta \) and \( y = r\sin\theta \) might help. The area element becomes \( r \, dr \, d\theta \). Let's rewrite both terms in polar coordinates:

1. First term numerator: \( 1 + 2r^2\cos^2\theta \)
2. First term denominator: \( 1 + r^4 + 4r^4\cos^2\theta\sin^2\theta \)
3. Second term numerator: \( 1 + r^2\sin^2\theta \)
4. Second term denominator: \( 2 + r^4(\cos^4\theta + \sin^4\theta) \)

For large \( r \), the leading terms in the numerators and denominators dominate. The first term's integrand behaves like \( \frac{2r^2\cos^2\theta}{r^4(1 + 4\cos^2\theta\sin^2\theta)} = \frac{2\cos^2\theta}{r^2(1 + 4\cos^2\theta\sin^2\theta)} \). Similarly, the second term's integrand behaves like \( \frac{r^2\sin^2\theta}{r^4(\cos^4\theta + \sin^4\theta)} = \frac{\sin^2\theta}{r^2(\cos^4\theta + \sin^4\theta)} \).

Subtracting these leading terms gives:

\[
\frac{2\cos^2\theta}{r^2(1 + 4\cos^2\theta\sin^2\theta)} - \frac{\sin^2\theta}{r^2(\cos^4\theta + \sin^4\theta)}
\]

Factoring out \( \frac{1}{r^2} \), we analyze the angular integral. This involves integrating the expression:

\[
\left( \frac{2\cos^2\theta}{1 + 4\cos^2\theta\sin^2\theta} - \frac{\sin^2\theta}{\cos^4\theta + \sin^4\theta} \right)
\]

over \( \theta \) from 0 to \( 2\pi \). Using substitutions and symmetry, it's found that this integral evaluates to zero. This implies that the leading term cancels out when integrated over \( \theta \), leaving higher-order terms that decay faster than \( \frac{1}{r^2} \).

Given the faster decay of the remaining terms, the integral over \( r \) converges as \( R \to \infty \). Since the leading term's contribution cancels out, the limit of \( I(R) \) as \( R \) approaches infinity is zero.

Paragraph 2, Sentence 1: <keep>Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but maybe there's some symmetry or substitution that can simplify it.</keep>  
Paragraph 2, Sentence 3: <keep>The first denominator is 1 + x4 + 6x2y2 + y4. Wait a second, that looks like it might factor or relate to (x2 + y2)2 or something similar.</keep>  
Paragraph 3, Sentence 1: <keep>(x2 + y2)2 = x4 + 2x2y2 + y4</keep>  
Paragraph 3, Sentence 2: <keep>But here, we have 6x2y2 instead of 2x2y2. So 1 + x4 + 6x2y2 + y4 = 1 + (x4 + y4) + 6x2y2.</keep>  
Paragraph 4, Sentence 1: <keep>The second denominator is 2 + x4 + y4. That seems simpler, but not obviously connected to the first denominator.</keep>  
Paragraph 5, Sentence 1: <keep>Since we're integrating over a disk of radius R, maybe switching to polar coordinates would be helpful.</keep>  
Paragraph 5, Sentence 3: <keep>In polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, so x2 + y2 = r2. Let's denote r2 = R2 so when R goes to infinity, we’ll have to see how the integrand behaves as r increases.</keep>  
Paragraph 6, Sentence 1: <keep>First fraction: Numerator: 1 + 2x2 = 1 + 2r2 cos2θ</keep>  
Paragraph 6, Sentence 4: <keep>Similarly, numerator is 1 + 2r2 cos2θ.</keep>  
Paragraph 6, Sentence 7: <keep>Second fraction: Numerator: 1 + y2 = 1 + r2 sin2θ</keep>  
Paragraph 6, Sentence 9: <keep>So denominator is 2 + r4 (cos4θ + sin4θ).</keep>  
Paragraph 7, Sentence 1: <keep>Multiply all terms by r (from area element) and integrate over θ from 0 to 2π and r from 0 to R.</keep>  
Paragraph 7, Sentence 3: <keep>If the integrand decays sufficiently fast, the integral over the entire plane (R→∞) would converge.</keep>  
Paragraph 8, Sentence 1: <keep>First term numerator: ~ 2r2 cos2θ (since 1 is negligible)</keep>  
Paragraph 8, Sentence 2: <keep>Denominator: ~ r^4 + 4r4 cos2θ sin2θ = r^4 (1 + 4 cos2θ sin2θ )</keep>  
Paragraph 8, Sentence 4: <keep>Similarly, the second fraction numerator: ~ r2 sin2θ</keep>  
Paragraph 8, Sentence 6: <keep>Thus, second term ~ (r2 sin2θ ) / [ r4 ( cos4θ + sin4θ ) ] = sin2θ / [ r2 ( cos4θ + sin4θ ) ]</keep>  
Paragraph 9, Sentence 1: <keep>Term1 - Term2 ~ [ 2 cos2θ / ( r2 (1 + 4 cos2θ sin2θ ) ) ] - [ sin2θ / ( r2 ( cos4θ + sin4θ ) ) ]</keep>  
Paragraph 9, Sentence 3: <keep>[ 2 cos2θ / (1 + 4 cos2θ sin2θ ) - sin2θ / ( cos4θ + sin4θ ) ] / r2</keep>  
Paragraph 10, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, the integrand for large r behaves like (something depending on θ) / r2, and then we have the area element which includes an r dr dθ. So the entire integrand becomes roughly (something) / r2 * r dr dθ = (something) / r dr dθ.</keep>  
Paragraph 10, Sentence 4: <keep>But integrating from R0 to ∞, ∫ 1/r dr diverges. However, perhaps the angular part cancels out?</keep>  
Paragraph 11, Sentence 1: <keep>If ∫0^{2π} f(θ) dθ is zero, then the integral would be zero regardless of R0. So maybe the angular average cancels.</keep>  
Paragraph 11, Sentence 3: <keep>A = ∫0^{2π} [ 2 cos2θ / (1 + 4 cos2θ sin2θ ) - sin2θ / ( cos4θ + sin4θ ) ] dθ</keep>  
Paragraph 12, Sentence 1: <keep>cos4θ + sin4θ = (cos2θ + sin2θ)^2 - 2 cos2θ sin2θ = 1 - 2 cos2θ sin2θ</keep>  
Paragraph 12, Sentence 2: <keep>So the second integral becomes ∫ sin2θ / (1 - 2 cos2θ sin2θ ) dθ</keep>  
Paragraph 13, Sentence 1: <keep>I1 = ∫0^{2π} [ cos2θ / (1 + 4 cos2θ sin2θ ) ] dθ</keep>  
Paragraph 13, Sentence 4: <keep>J = (1/2) ∫0^{2π} [1 / (1 + sin2(2θ) ) ] dθ</keep>  
Paragraph 14, Sentence 1: <keep>Using substitution phi = 2θ, integrating over phi from 0 to 4π, and periodicity, we find J = π / sqrt(2)</keep>  
Paragraph 14, Sentence 2: <keep>Thus, I1 = π / sqrt(2)</keep>  
Paragraph 15, Sentence 1: <keep>For I2, similar substitutions and computations show it equals sqrt(2) π</keep>  
Paragraph 15, Sentence 2: <keep>Subtracting I1 and I2: A = 2*(π/sqrt(2)) - sqrt(2) π = 0</keep>  
Paragraph 16, Sentence 1: <keep>Since the leading term cancels, higher-order terms decay faster, leading to a convergent integral</keep>  
Paragraph 17, Sentence 1: <keep>Further analysis confirms the integrand decays sufficiently fast, making the integral converge to zero.</keep>
