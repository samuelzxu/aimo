Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. We need to compute the sum of the function f(i/2009) from i=1 to 2009. The function is given as f(x) = x^5 divided by a quartic polynomial. 

First, I'll examine the denominator: 5x^4 - 10x^3 + 10x^2 - 5x + 1. The coefficients here remind me of the expansion of (1 - x)^5, but reversed. Let me confirm this. Expanding (1 - x)^5 gives 1 - 5x + 10x^2 - 10x^3 + 5x^4 - x^5. Reversing the coefficients results in -x^5 + 5x^4 - 10x^3 + 10x^2 - 5x + 1, which matches the denominator except for the -x^5 term. This suggests a symmetry.

Next, I'll check if f(x) has a symmetry property. Let's compute f(1 - x). The denominator for f(1 - x) expands to 5(1 - x)^4 - 10(1 - x)^3 + 10(1 - x)^2 - 5(1 - x) + 1. Expanding each term and combining them, I find that the denominator for f(1 - x) is identical to the original denominator. Thus, f(1 - x) = (1 - x)^5 / denominator. 

Adding f(x) and f(1 - x), the numerators x^5 + (1 - x)^5 simplify to the denominator polynomial, resulting in f(x) + f(1 - x) = 1. This is a key insight: pairs of terms symmetric around 0.5 sum to 1.

Considering the sum from i=1 to 2009, each term i/2009 pairs with (2009 - i)/2009. However, since 2009 is odd, there's a middle term at i=1005. Pairing each i from 1 to 1004 with their symmetric counterpart from 2008 down to 1005 gives 1004 pairs, each summing to 1. The remaining term at i=1005 is f(1005/2009), and the term at i=2009 (x=1) contributes 1.

To verify, let S be the original sum and S' be the sum of f(1 - x) terms. Using symmetry, S + S' = 2009. Since S' = S - f(1) + f(0) and f(1)=1, f(0)=0, solving 2S - 1 = 2009 gives S=1005. Thus, the answer is 1005.
