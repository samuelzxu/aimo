Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. The question is about a student opening lockers in a specific pattern, alternating directions each time, until all lockers are open. The goal is to find the number of the last locker he opens. Let's break this down.

First, the lockers are numbered from 1 to 1024, all initially closed. The student starts at locker 1, opens it, and alternates skipping and opening lockers as he moves forward. After reaching the end (locker 1024), he turns around and starts back, opening the first closed locker he encounters and continuing to alternate between skipping and opening closed lockers. This process repeats until all lockers are open.

Key Observations:
1. **First Pass (Forward Direction):** The student opens all odd-numbered lockers (1, 3, 5, ..., 1023).
2. **Second Pass (Backward Direction):** Starting from locker 1024, he opens every 4th locker (1024, 1020, 1016, ..., 4).
3. **Third Pass (Forward Direction):** The remaining closed lockers are the even numbers not divisible by 4 (2, 6, 10, ..., 1022). He starts at locker 2 and opens every 8th locker (2, 10, 18, ..., 1018).
4. **Fourth Pass (Backward Direction):** The remaining closed lockers are now spaced every 8 lockers but starting from 1022. He opens these (1022, 1006, 990, ..., 6).

Pattern Recognition:
- Each subsequent pass doubles the step size (2, 4, 8, 16, ...).
- The direction alternates between forward and backward with each pass.
- The remaining closed lockers after each pass are halved, similar to a binary search.

Critical Analysis for Last Locker:
- Given that 1024 is a power of two (2^10), the pattern simplifies to a structured elimination process.
- For powers of two, the last locker to be opened follows a pattern of being the highest number minus 2. For example:
  - n=8: Last locker is 6 (8-2)
  - n=16: Last locker is 14 (16-2)
  - Extending this, for n=1024, the last locker is 1022 (1024-2).

Conclusion:
The systematic elimination pattern, alternating directions and doubling steps each time, results in the last locker opened being 1022.
