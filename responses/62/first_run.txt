To solve the problem of finding the least positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^2 - m + 11 \) is a product of at least four not necessarily distinct primes, we analyze the quadratic expression and its factorization for various values of \( m \).

1. **Initial Testing for Small \( m \)**:
   - For values of \( m \) from 1 to 10, \( m^2 - m + 11 \) results in prime numbers.
   - For \( m = 11 \), the expression results in \( 11^2 \), which is a product of two primes.

2. **Factorization Patterns**:
   - Noticing that \( m^2 - m + 11 \) is divisible by 11 when \( m \equiv 0 \) or \( 1 \mod 11 \), we check values of \( m \) that are multiples of 11 or one more than multiples of 11.
   - For these values, \( m^2 - m + 11 \) can be written as \( 11 \times \text{(another factor)} \). However, up to \( m = 110 \), these factors are either prime or products of two primes.

3. **Higher Values of \( m \)**:
   - Testing higher values, we find that for \( m = 132 \), the expression \( 132^2 - 132 + 11 \) results in \( 17303 \).
   - Factorizing \( 17303 \), we get \( 11^3 \times 13 \), which is a product of four primes (counting multiplicities).

4. **Verification**:
   - The factorization \( 11^3 \times 13 \) confirms that \( 17303 \) is indeed a product of at least four primes, satisfying the problem's requirement.

Through systematic testing and analysis, we determine that the smallest \( m \) meeting the criteria is \( 132 \).

- **Paragraph 2, Sentence 1**: <keep>Find the least positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^2 - m + 11 \) is a product of at least four not necessarily distinct primes.</keep>
- **Paragraph 3, Sentence 1**: <keep>First, maybe I should start by understanding what the question is asking.</keep>
- **Paragraph 4, Sentence 1**: <keep>Starting with \( m = 1 \): \( 1^2 - 1 + 11 = 11 \). 11 is prime. So that's only one prime factor, not enough.</keep>
- **Paragraph 4, Sentence 2**: <keep>\( m = 2 \): \( 4 - 2 + 11 = 13 \). Also prime. Still 1 prime factor.</keep>
- **Paragraph 4, Sentence 3**: <keep>\( m = 3 \): \( 9 - 3 + 11 = 17 \). Prime again. Not enough.</keep>
- **Paragraph 5, Sentence 1**: <keep>\( m = 11 \): 121. 121 is 11×11, so two prime factors.</keep>
- **Paragraph 5, Sentence 2**: <keep>At m=11, it's 121, which is two primes. So the total number is two, not enough.</keep>
- **Paragraph 6, Sentence 1**: <keep>if m=11k. The expression becomes: \( 11*(11k^2 -k +1) \). Therefore, factors are 11 and (11k^2 -k +1).</keep>
- **Paragraph 7, Sentence 1**: <keep>Therefore, for the total to be at least four primes, that (11k^2 -k +1) must be a product of at least three primes.</keep>
- **Paragraph 10, Sentence 1**: <keep>For example, m=55:55^2=3025 -55=2970+11=2981. Factor 2981. Divisible by 11? 2981: 11*271=2981. So 11*271, two primes.</keep>
- **Paragraph 11, Sentence 1**: <keep>When m=11k or 11k+1, the number will have at least one 11 factor.</keep>
- **Paragraph 11, Sentence 2**: <keep>If the remaining part can be factored further into three primes, then the total would have four prime factors.</keep>
- **Paragraph 13, Sentence 1**: <keep>Thus, when m=132 (k=12), let’s compute \( m=132 \): 132^2 -132 +11=17303. Check if divisible by 121. 121*143=17303. Then, 143=11*13. Therefore, 17303=121*143=11^3*13. Therefore, prime factors of 17303 are 11, 11, 11,13. four prime factors.</keep>
- **Paragraph 13, Sentence 2**: <keep>Therefore,when m=132, \( m^2 -m +11=11^3*13 \), four prime factors.</keep>
- **Paragraph 15, Sentence 1**: <keep>Through systematic testing and analysis, we determine that the smallest \( m \) meeting the criteria is \( 132 \).</keep>
- **Final Answer**: <keep>\boxed{132}</keep>
