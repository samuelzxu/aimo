Alright, let's tackle the user's problem step by step. The task is to optimize the reasoning output by identifying essential tokens for future reasoning steps using <keep> tags. The provided solution includes two parts: part (a) calculating an integral and part (b) evaluating an infinite series. 

For part (a), the solution uses integration by parts and differentiation under the integral sign. The critical steps here are the application of integration by parts, evaluating the boundary terms (especially the limit as x approaches 0), and confirming the result with an alternative method. These steps are fundamental for verifying the integral's result, so the tokens related to setting up integration by parts, boundary term evaluation, and the cross-check should be preserved.

In part (b), the key reasoning involves swapping the order of summation, recognizing the series as related to the Dirichlet eta function, transforming the series into an integral using part (a)'s result, and then evaluating the integral via integration by parts. The crucial steps here include the interchange of sums and integrals, the geometric series summation, and the final integration leading to the natural logarithm. These parts are essential for the series evaluation and must be retained.

The user specifically mentioned the need to mark essential tokens for future reasoning, which includes mathematical steps, key equations, critical substitutions, and results that form the foundation for subsequent conclusions. Ensuring that these elements are preserved will allow for efficient context usage without losing necessary information.

Now, to satisfy the requirement of at least 31 kept blocks, I'll systematically identify each crucial part of the reasoning, ensuring that each marked section is a complete phrase or equation necessary for continuing the reasoning process.
