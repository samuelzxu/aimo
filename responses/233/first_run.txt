Okay, let me figure out which tokens are essential for future reasoning steps in this problem. 

First, the problem involves finding the probability that the slope between a random point P in the unit square and the fixed point (5/8, 3/8) is at least 1/2. The key steps involve setting up the inequality for the slope, considering the cases where x is greater than or less than 5/8, determining the regions of the square that satisfy the inequality, and calculating the areas of these regions.

The critical parts to retain are the derived inequalities for each case (x > 5/8 and x < 5/8), the integral calculations for the areas, and the final probability fraction 43/128. These sections contain the equations and results necessary for verifying the steps and ensuring the correct final answer.

I need to mark the sentences where these key equations and results are presented. For example, the slope inequality transformations, the integral expressions for area calculations, and the simplification to 43/128. Each of these blocks is crucial for understanding how the areas were computed and how the probability was derived.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 4: <keep>The slope of the line PQ should be greater than or equal to 1/2. The slope formula between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). Here, P is (x, y) and Q is (5/8, 3/8). So the slope is (y - 3/8)/(x - 5/8). We need this slope to be ≥ 1/2.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, the condition we need is: (y - 3/8)/(x - 5/8) ≥ 1/2.</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 1: <keep>So: y ≥ (1/2)x + 1/16</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 1: <keep>So: y ≤ (1/2)x + 1/16</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 1: <keep>The line y = (1/2)x + 1/16 is a straight line passing through certain points.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 5: <keep>Plugging x = 5/8 into the line equation: y = (1/2)(5/8) + 1/16 = 5/16 + 1/16 = 6/16 = 3/8. So Q is exactly on the line.</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, the region where slope is greater than or equal to 1/2 is the area above the line for x > 5/8 and below the line for x < 5/8.</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentence 1: <keep>Compute that: (1/2)x - 5/16 + 6/16 = (1/2)x + 1/16</keep>
- Paragraph 16, Sentence 1: <keep>area1 = ∫0^(5/8) [(1/2)x +1/16] dx</keep>
- Paragraph 16, Sentence 4: <keep>So total area1 = 25/256 +10/256=35/256.</keep>
- Paragraph 17, Sentence 1: <keep>Now area2: the area to the right of x=5/8 (x from5/8 to1), where y is above the line y=(1/2)x +1/16.</keep>
- Paragraph 17, Sentence 4: <keep>area2 = ∫_(5/8)^1 [15/16 - (1/2)x] dx</keep>
- Paragraph 18, Sentence 1: <keep>Compute the integral: Integral of 15/16 dx from5/8 to1: 15/16*(1 -5/8) =15/16*(3/8) = 45/128</keep>
- Paragraph 18, Sentence 7: <keep>Therefore, area2 =51/256</keep>
- Paragraph 19, Sentence 1: <keep>So total area where slope >=1/2 is 35/256 +51/256=86/256</keep>
- Paragraph 19, Sentence 3: <keep>Simplify this: 86 ÷2=43, 256÷2=128, so 43/128</keep>
- Paragraph 20, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, the probability is43/128.</keep>
- Paragraph 20, Sentence 3: <keep>Therefore, m=43 and n=128. Therefore, m +n=171.</keep>
- Paragraph 21, Sentence 1: <keep>Take a point below the line on the right: (0.7,0.4). Slope=(0.4 -3/8)/(0.7 -5/8)= (0.4 -0.375)/(0.075)=0.025/0.075≈0.333... which is <0.5. Which also matches the inequality.</keep>
- Paragraph 22, Sentence 1: <check>Check:35 +51=86, 86/256=43/128≈0.3359.</check>
- Paragraph 23, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, the answer should be171.</keep>
- Paragraph 24, Sentence 1: <keep>\boxed{171}</keep>
