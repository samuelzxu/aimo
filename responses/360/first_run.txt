Okay, let me go through the Deepseek's thought process and identify the key parts that are essential for future reasoning steps. The problem is about salary distribution in regions and whether certain conditions can be met. The user needs to know which parts of the reasoning are critical to keep for further analysis.

First, the problem is restated in the thinking trajectory, which is important to understand the scenario. Then, there are calculations and derivations where the user defines variables and sets up equations. These steps are crucial because they form the basis of the mathematical reasoning.

Key points to retain include the setup of high earners vs. low earners, their respective salaries, and the inequalities derived to check the feasibility. The critical calculations where ratios are compared (like 8.889x + 0.0111 ≤ 0.97779x + 0.01221) should be kept since they lead to the conclusion that the proportion of high earners per region must be extremely low.

Additionally, the realization that distributing high earners across regions would require more low earners than available nationally is pivotal. This part of the reasoning highlights the impossibility due to resource constraints (low earners), which directly answers the original question.

The final answer is also essential as it concludes the entire reasoning process. However, intermediate steps that led to that conclusion must be preserved to validate the answer's correctness.

Ensuring that each kept section is a complete sentence or phrase and matches the original text precisely is important for clarity. The user needs to see exactly which parts of the reasoning are necessary without any paraphrasing.

After marking the kept sections, the final answer is confirmed to be \boxed{No}, which must be included as well.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 1: <keep>First, let me parse the problem again to make sure I understand it. The country has a highly unequal salary distribution: the top 10% earners get 90% of all the salary. Now, this country is divided into several regions. The question is whether it's possible that in each region, the top 10% of employees (by salary) don't get more than 11% of that region's total salary.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 1: <keep>I think this might be related to the concept of the Pareto principle or the 80/20 rule, but in this case, it's 10% getting 90%. The problem is asking if this concentration can be disguised by partitioning the country into regions where each region seems to have a much more equal distribution.</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 1: <keep>Let’s denote:

- Total salary in the country: S.
- Number of employees in the country: N.
- 10% of employees (high earners) earn 90% of S, so each high earner gets (0.9S)/(0.1N) = 9S/N.
- The remaining 90% of employees (low earners) earn 10% of S, so each low earner gets (0.1S)/(0.9N) ≈ 0.111S/N.

So high earners earn 81 times more than low earners (9 / 0.111 ≈ 81).</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 1: <keep>Suppose each region has H high earners and L low earners. The total number of employees in the region is H + L.

We need that in each region, the top 10% of employees (by salary) earn no more than 11% of the region's total salary.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 1: <keep>So, to rephrase, in each region, the number of high earners (H) must be such that their total salary is ≤ 11% of the region's total salary.</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 1: <keep>Let’s consider a single region. Let’s say in that region, there are n employees. The total salary paid in that region is s.

We need that the total salary of the top 10% of employees in this region is ≤ 11% of s.</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 1: <keep>Compute the ratio:

[ h*9 + (0.1n - h)*0.111 ] / [ h*9 + (n - h)*0.111 ] ≤ 0.11

Multiply numerator and denominator by S/N to get back in terms of actual salaries, where each high earner earns 9S/N and each low earner 0.111S/N.</keep>
- Paragraph 14, Sentence 1: <keep>Let me compute both sides.

Left Side (LS):

= 9x + 0.111*(0.1 - x)
= 9x + 0.0111 - 0.111x
= (9 - 0.111)x + 0.0111
= 8.889x + 0.0111

Right Side (RS):

= 0.11*(9x + 0.111*(1 - x))
= 0.11*(9x + 0.111 - 0.111x)
= 0.11*(8.889x + 0.111)
= 0.11*8.889x + 0.11*0.111
= 0.97779x + 0.01221</keep>
- Paragraph 15, Sentence 1: <keep>So we need:

8.889x + 0.0111 ≤ 0.97779x + 0.01221</keep>
- Paragraph 16, Sentence 1: <keep>Solving for x:

-7.91121x + 0.00111 ≥ 0

7.91121x ≤ 0.00111

x ≤ 0.00111 / 7.91121 ≈ 0.0001403</keep>
- Paragraph 17, Sentence 1: <keep>So x ≤ ~0.01403%, meaning that the proportion of high earners in each region must be less than about 0.014%.</keep>
- Paragraph 19, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, the number of low earners in the region must be at least approximately 7127 times the number of high earners.</keep>
- Paragraph 20, Sentence 1: <keep>Given that each region has n = h + l employees, and l ≥ 7127h, that means n ≈ l ≈ 7127h.</keep>
- Paragraph 22, Sentence 1: <keep>This would require that the total number of high earners (0.1N) is ≤ 0.00014 * Total employees across all regions. But Total employees across all regions is N, so 0.00014N. But 0.1N > 0.00014N, which is impossible.</keep>
- Paragraph 25, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, the conclusion would be that it's impossible.</keep>
- Paragraph 27, Sentence 1: <keep>Thus, [high earners'] total salary would be H*(high salary) + (0.1n - H)*(low salary). We need this total to be ≤ 0.11s, where s = H*(high salary) + (n - H)*(low salary).</keep>
- Paragraph 29, Sentence 1: <keep>Multiply both sides by denominator:

8.9001h + 0.0111l ≤ 0.11*(9h + 0.111l)</keep>
- Paragraph 30, Sentence 1: <keep>Compute right side:

= 0.99h + 0.01221l</keep>
- Paragraph 31, Sentence 1: <keep>Bring all terms to left:

8.9001h - 0.99h + 0.0111l - 0.01221l ≤ 0</keep>
- Paragraph 33, Sentence 1: <keep>So,

7.9101h ≤ 0.00111l</keep>
- Paragraph 35, Sentence 1: <keep>But nationally, high earners are 10% of all employees. So how do we fit 10% of all employees into ≤0.014% per region?</keep>
- Paragraph 37, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, it's impossible.</keep>
- Paragraph 39, Sentence 1: <keep>Total low earners needed:0.1*N *7127.

But the total number of low earners is 0.9*N.

Thus, we require:

0.1*N*7127 ≤0.9*N

=>712.7 ≤0.9

But 712.7<=0.9 is false.</keep>
- Paragraph 40, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, mathematically, the resource (low earners) required surpasses what's available nationally, making it impossible.</keep>
- Paragraph 41, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, the answer is \boxed{No}</keep>

\boxed{No}
