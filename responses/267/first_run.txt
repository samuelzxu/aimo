Okay, let's break down the steps to identify which tokens need to be kept for future reasoning. The key is to focus on crucial equations, relationships, and results that are necessary for calculating the area of the triangle FGH for each angle φ.

First, the coordinates of points E and F are essential. The vertical line through H(α, 0) gives E on the ellipse and F on the auxiliary circle. Their coordinates are derived as:
- E: (α, √(3 - 3α²/4))
- F: (α, √(4 - α²))

Next, the tangent at E to the ellipse intersects the x-axis at G(4/α, 0), which is critical for determining the triangle's vertices.

The area of triangle FGH is calculated using the base (HG = 4/α - α) and height (F's y-coordinate). This results in the area formula:
Area = (4 - α²)^(3/2) / (2α)

The relationship between α and φ comes from the line OF, where tanφ = √(4 - α²)/α. Solving this gives α = 2cosφ, which substitutes into the area formula to express it in terms of φ:
Area = 2 sin³φ / cosφ

Each value of φ (π/4, π/3, π/6, π/12) is substituted into this formula to compute the corresponding area, matching them with the given options. The critical steps involve the derivations of α in terms of φ and the simplified area expressions for each angle.

The final answer mappings are:
- φ=π/4 → Area=1 (Q)
- φ=π/3 → Area=3√3/2 (T)
- φ=π/6 → Area=1/(2√3) (S)
- φ=π/12 → Area=(√3 -1)^4 /8 (P)

These mappings correspond to option (C).
