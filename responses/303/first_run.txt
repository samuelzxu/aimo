Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. We need to find the greatest possible value of \( a^3 + b^3 + c^3 \) given the system of equations. 

First, notice each equation has the form \( \text{variable}^3 - xyz = \text{constant} \). Subtracting pairs of equations gives differences in their cubes. Letting \( A = x^3 \), \( B = y^3 \), \( C = z^3 \), we find \( B - A = 4 \), \( C - B = 14 \), and \( C - A = 18 \). Solving these linear relations, we get \( B = A + 4 \) and \( C = A + 18 \).

Summing the original equations: \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = 28 \). Substituting \( A, B, C \) gives \( 3A + 22 - 3xyz = 28 \), leading to \( A - xyz = 2 \). Since \( xyz = A - 2 \), substituting \( x, y, z \) as cube roots of \( A, A+4, A+18 \) gives the equation \( \sqrt[3]{A(A+4)(A+18)} = A - 2 \).

Cubing both sides and simplifying results in the quadratic \( 7A^2 + 15A + 2 = 0 \), yielding solutions \( A = -\frac{1}{7} \) and \( A = -2 \). Calculating \( A + B + C \) for these, the maximum is \( \frac{151}{7} \), leading to \( m + n = 158 \).
