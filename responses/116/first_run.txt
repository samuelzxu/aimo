Okay, let's break down the thought process here. The user needs to determine which statement about long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) is incorrect. The key is to identify which option contains the untruth.

First, the reasoning identifies that lncRNAs are over 200 nucleotides and non-coding. Each answer choice is analyzed based on known functions of lncRNAs. For option A, the critical point is whether circularization occurs via hydrogen bonds or covalent bonds. The conclusion is that covalent bonds (as in circRNAs) are the correct mechanism, making A incorrect. Options B, C, and D are confirmed as true based on examples like XIST, miRNA sponging, and splicing modulation.

Essential tokens include the differentiation between covalent and hydrogen bonding in circularization, references to XIST for chromosome inactivation, miRNA sponging, and splice factor interaction. These points are crucial for validating each option's truthfulness and identifying the incorrect statement.

- Paragraph 1, Sentence 8: <keep>Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are covalently closed, I think.</keep>  
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 1: <keep>They can be involved in inactivation of whole chromosomes. That's X-inactivation, right? XIST is a lncRNA that inactivates one X chromosome in females.</keep>  
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 1: <keep>They can interact with specific splice factors thereby modulating alternative splicing. Splicing factors are proteins involved in splicing. Some lncRNAs interact with these proteins to influence which exons are included.</keep>
