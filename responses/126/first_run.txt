Alright, let's tackle this problem. We need to find all real numbers x such that x² + floor(x/2) + floor(x/3) = 10. Hmm, floor functions can complicate things since they depend on integer divisions. Let me start by understanding the components.

First, the floor functions ⌊x/2⌋ and ⌊x/3⌋ are integers because floor functions return the greatest integer less than or equal to the input. So their sum is also an integer, which means x² must be 10 minus an integer. Therefore, x² must be a non-negative number, and 10 - (⌊x/2⌋ + ⌊x/3⌋) ≥ 0. So, ⌊x/2⌋ + ⌊x/3⌋ ≤ 10.

Let me denote m = ⌊x/2⌋ and n = ⌊x/3⌋. Then the equation becomes x² + m + n = 10. Also, from the definitions of floor functions, we have:
- 2m ≤ x < 2(m + 1)
- 3n ≤ x < 3(n + 1)

Thus, x must lie in the intersection of these intervals. Let's consider positive and negative x separately.

Starting with positive x. If x is positive, m and n are non-negative integers. x² can't exceed 10, so x ≤ √10 ≈ 3.16. Breaking down intervals:
- [0, 2): m = 0, n = 0 → x² = 10 → x = √10 ≈ 3.16 (not in [0,2))
- [2, 3): m = 1, n = 0 → x² = 9 → x = 3 (not in [2,3))
- [3, 4): m = 1, n = 1 → x² = 8 → x ≈ 2.828 (not in [3,4))

No solutions for positive x.

Now, negative x. Consider x < 0. Here, m and n are negative integers. For example:
- x ∈ [-4, -3): m = -2 (since x/2 ∈ [-2, -1.5)), n = -2 (since x/3 ∈ [-1.333, -1))
  - Equation: x² + (-2) + (-2) = 10 → x² = 14 → x = -√14 ≈ -3.7417 (valid in [-4, -3))

Other intervals for negative x were checked (like [-6, -4), [-3, -2)), but solutions fell outside the intervals or didn't satisfy the equation. Thus, only x = -√14 works.

Final check: Plugging x = -√14, we get x² = 14, ⌊-√14/2⌋ = -2, ⌊-√14/3⌋ = -2. Sum: 14 - 2 - 2 = 10. Correct.
