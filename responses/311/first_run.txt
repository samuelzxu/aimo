Okay, let me start by understanding what the problem is asking. We have four positive real numbers a, b, c, d that satisfy the equation 36a + 4b + 4c + 3d = 25. We need to find the maximum value of the expression a × √b × ∛c × ∜d. 

First, I recall that optimization problems often use methods like Lagrange multipliers or the AM-GM inequality. The expression involves different roots, so converting them into exponents might help. Let's rewrite the expression as a × b^(1/2) × c^(1/3) × d^(1/4). 

Considering Lagrange multipliers, we set up the Lagrangian function with the constraint. The partial derivatives of this function with respect to each variable and lambda should be zero. Solving these equations should give the optimal values for a, b, c, d. 

From the partial derivatives, we derive relationships between the variables. For example, comparing the partial derivatives with respect to a and b gives b = (9/2)a. Similarly, comparing others gives c = 3a and d = 3a. 

Substituting these into the constraint equation 36a + 4b + 4c + 3d = 25, we replace b, c, d with expressions in terms of a. This leads to solving 75a = 25, so a = 1/3. Plugging back, we get b = 3/2, c = 1, d = 1.

Calculating the original expression with these values: (1/3) × √(3/2) × ∛1 × ∜1 simplifies to (1/3) × √(3/2). Rationalizing, this becomes √6/6. 

Verifying the constraint with these values confirms they're correct. So the maximum value is √6/6, boxed as the final answer.
