Okay, so the user wants me to identify which parts of the reasoning are essential for solving the problem of finding the lateral displacement of an electromagnetic wave after total internal reflection. The key here is to pick out the tokens that are crucial for the final calculation. Let's go through the thought process step by step.

First, the user considered various formulas for the Goos-Hänchen shift. They mentioned the confusion between using tanθ and sinθ in the formula. The critical part here is when they discovered that using sinθ instead of tanθ gives an answer matching option B. That seems crucial.

Next, checking the critical angle was important to confirm that total internal reflection occurs. The calculation for the critical angle (around 46 degrees) and verifying that 80 degrees is beyond that is essential information.

The refractive indices and the given wavelength in medium 1 (400 nm) are necessary numbers for substitution into the formula. Any sentence mentioning n1=1.75, n2=1.26, λ=400 nm should be kept.

They went through multiple formula derivations and finally settled on one that uses sinθ, leading to 134.5 nm. The steps where they computed (n1/n2)^2, sinθ, and the sqrt of the denominator part are all necessary.

Also, the part where they realized that projecting the Goos-Hänchen shift with cosθ (even though that's a bit confusing) led to the correct answer might be important, but maybe that's a secondary consideration.

The final answer selection of B is based on substituting values into the formula with sinθ. The exact substitution steps are key here.

So, the essential tokens would include the correct formula used, the substitution of the given numbers into that formula, and the critical calculations that lead to the answer matching option B. Any other tangents about alternative formulas or incorrect calculations can be omitted unless they directly lead to the correct approach.

I need to make sure to capture all the mathematical steps where the user computes the components of the formula: n1/n2 ratio, sinθ, tanθ, the square root term, and the final multiplication/division leading to 134.5 nm. Also, the conclusion that this matches option B is vital.

Also, the part where they checked the critical angle to confirm TIR is necessary for validating the problem setup.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 1: <keep>First, I recall that when light undergoes total internal reflection, there's a lateral displacement of the reflected beam known as the Goos-Hänchen shift. I need to calculate that.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 1: <keep>First, compute (n1/n2)^2:</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 2: <keep>n1 = 1.75, n2 = 1.26.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 3: <keep>(n1 / n2) = 1.75 / 1.26 ≈ 1.3889. Squared: (1.3889)^2 ≈ 1.929.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 4: <keep>Then compute (n1/n2)^2 * sin^2(i):</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 5: <keep>sin(80°) ≈ 0.9848. So squared: (0.9848)^2 ≈ 0.9698.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 6: <keep>Multiply by 1.929: 1.929 * 0.9698 ≈ 1.871.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 7: <keep>Subtracting 1, we have sqrt(1.871 - 1) = sqrt(0.871) ≈ 0.9333.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 8: <keep>Now, divide tan(i) by the sqrt value: 5.671 / 0.9333 ≈ 6.077.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 9: <keep>Multiply by λ1 / π. λ1 is 400 nm.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 10: <keep>D_TE ≈ (400 / π) * 6.077 ≈ (400 * 6.077) / 3.1416 ≈ (2430.8) / 3.1416 ≈ approximately 774 nm.</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 1: <keep>Wait, but this result isn't among the answer choices.</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 1: <keep>So compute i0 = arcsin(n2 / n1) = arcsin(1.26 / 1.75). Let me compute 1.26 divided by 1.75: 1.26 / 1.75 ≈ 0.72. So arcsin(0.72) ≈ 46 degrees.</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 2: <keep>So yes, 80 degrees is greater than the critical angle ~46 degrees.</keep>
- Paragraph 21, Sentence 1: <keep>But in this problem, the wavelength in medium 1 is given as λ = 400 nm, that is λ1 = λ0 / n1 => λ0 = n1 * λ1.</keep>
- Paragraph 21, Sentence 2: <keep>Therefore, the wave number k1 = 2π / λ1.</keep>
- Paragraph 31, Sentence 1: <keep>Compute D = (400 nm / π) * (5.671 / 0.934) ≈ (400 / 3.1416) * (6.073) ≈ (127.323) * 6.073 ≈ 773.7 nm</keep>
- Paragraph 40, Sentence 1: <keep>But problem had a different derivation.</keep>
- Paragraph 42, Sentence 1: <keep>According to Section 19.4 in Ghatak's Optics, the lateral shift for a TE wave is D = ( lambda / pi ) * [ sin(theta) / sqrt{ ( sin^2(theta) - sin^2(theta_c) ) } ] , where theta_c is the critical angle.</keep>
- Paragraph 42, Sentence 2: <keep>Computing D:</keep>
- Paragraph 42, Sentence 3: <keep>sin(theta) / sqrt( sin^2(theta) - sin^2(theta_c) ) )</keep>
- Paragraph 42, Sentence 4: <keep>Compute numerator: sin(80)=0.9848.</keep>
- Paragraph 42, Sentence 5: <keep>Denominator: sqrt( sin(80)^2 - sin(46)^2 )≈ sqrt(0.9698 - 0.7193)= sqrt(0.2505)=0.5.</keep>
- Paragraph 42, Sentence 6: <keep>Thus, D= (400 / π) * (0.9848/0.5)= (400 * 0.9848 *2 ) / π≈ (787.84)/3.1416≈250.8 nm.</keep>
- Paragraph 48, Sentence 1: <keep>D = (400 / π) * [ sin(80) / sqrt( (n1/n2)^2 sin^2(80) -1 ) ]</keep>
- Paragraph 48, Sentence 2: <keep>So:</keep>
- Paragraph 48, Sentence 3: <keep>n1/n2=1.75/1.26≈1.388.</keep>
- Paragraph 48, Sentence 4: <keep>(n1/n2)^2≈1.928.</keep>
- Paragraph 48, Sentence 5: <keep>Multiply by sin^2(80)=0.9698≈1.870.</keep>
- Paragraph 48, Sentence 6: <keep>Subtract 1 to get 0.870. sqrt(0.870)≈0.933.</keep>
- Paragraph 48, Sentence 7: <keep>Therefore:</keep>
- Paragraph 48, Sentence 8: <keep>D=(400/3.1416)*(0.9848/0.933)≈(127.32)*(1.055)≈134.4 nm.</keep>
- Paragraph 48, Sentence 9: <keep>Which matches option B.</keep>
- Paragraph 50, Sentence 1: <keep>If the original calculation gives D≈773 nm along the interface.</keep>
- Paragraph 50, Sentence 2: <keep>However, if the problem defines lateral displacement as the component perpendicular to the beam direction.</keep>
- Paragraph 50, Sentence 3: <keep>D_perp= D * cos(theta)= 773 * cos(80)= 773 *0.1736≈134.5 nm.</keep>
- Paragraph 50, Sentence 4: <keep>Ah! That's option B.</keep>
- Paragraph 50, Sentence 5: <keep>Therefore, if the question defines lateral displacement as the component perpendicular to the beam direction, which is D_perp= D * cos(theta).</keep>
- Paragraph 51, Sentence 1: <keep>But, according to our calculations using the GH shift formula with tan(theta), getting D≈773 nm, but options given are 134.56 nm.</keep>
- Paragraph 51, Sentence 2: <keep>But when considering the projection of GH shift along the direction perpendicular to the original beam.</keep>
- Paragraph 52, Sentence 1: <keep>After a lot of confusion, I suspect that the correct answer is B, 134.56 nm, which arises from using the formula with sin(theta).</keep>
- Paragraph 52, Sentence 2: <keep>Though perhaps the answer uses a different approach.</keep>
- Paragraph 52, Sentence 3: <keep>Given that sin and tan differ a lot here.</keep>
- Paragraph 53, Sentence 1: <keep>At this point, after crunching all scenarios, the only way to get an answer as per the given options is via taking D= (lambda/pi)*(sintheta/sqrt(... )), leading to 134.NM.</keep>
- Paragraph 53, Sentence 2: <keep>Since this matches option B,and given that I don't have access to the specific formula the problem assumes, given the time invested, i'll opt for B.</keep>
