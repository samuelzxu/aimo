Okay, let me try to break down how I arrived at the answer. The question involves a series of organic reactions leading to a final product, and we need to determine its theoretical 1H-NMR spectrum. The key steps involve oxidation, salt formation, organolithium reaction, acid treatment, and finally reaction with dimethylamine.

First, the starting material is 2-methylpropan-1-ol, which is a primary alcohol. Oxidation with potassium dichromate in sulfuric acid typically converts primary alcohols to carboxylic acids. So, product A would be 2-methylpropanoic acid (isobutyric acid).

Next, reacting A with LiOH forms the lithium carboxylate (B). Then, reacting B with lithium propan-2-ide (an organolithium reagent) likely leads to alkylation at the alpha position of the carboxylate, forming a branched structure. Acid workup and heating (step 4) might not change much if the product is already stable, leaving D as a branched carboxylic acid.

Finally, reacting D with dimethylamine and H+ forms an amide. The NMR of the amide would show a singlet for the dimethylamino group and signals corresponding to the alkyl chains. 

Looking at the answer choices, option B includes a singlet at 2.73 ppm (6H, s) for N(CH3)2 and other peaks matching isopropyl groups (septet and doublet) and a possible ethyl chain. This aligns with the expected structure after the reactions described. The triplet at 4.79 ppm likely corresponds to a proton adjacent to the amide group. 

So, the correct answer is B.
