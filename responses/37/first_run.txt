Okay, let's start by understanding the problem. We have two sequences: integers \( (a_i) \) and positive integers \( (k_i) \). The matrix \( A \) is constructed such that each entry \( A_{i,j} = a_i^{k_j} \). We need to prove that \( 2015! \) divides the determinant of \( A \).

First, consider the structure of matrix \( A \). Each row corresponds to a fixed \( a_i \) with varying exponents \( k_j \). This setup resembles a generalized Vandermonde matrix, though with arbitrary exponents instead of sequential powers. 

Key steps in the reasoning include:

1. **Alternating Property**: The determinant of \( A \) is an alternating multilinear function of the rows. Swapping two rows changes the determinant's sign, implying it's divisible by the differences of the variables, similar to the Vandermonde determinant.

2. **Vandermonde Determinant Connection**: The Vandermonde determinant \( \prod_{1 \leq i < j \leq 2015} (a_j - a_i) \) is a factor of the determinant of \( A \). This product ensures divisibility by pairwise differences of \( a_i \).

3. **Prime Divisibility**: For each prime \( p \leq 2015 \), the columns of \( A \) modulo \( p \) form a linearly dependent set due to the pigeonhole principle. This ensures \( \det(A) \equiv 0 \mod p \), implying divisibility by all primes up to 2015.

4. **Factorial Divisibility**: Since \( \det(A) \) is divisible by all primes \( p \leq 2015 \), it must be divisible by the product of these primes. The factorial \( 2015! \) includes all these primes with their respective multiplicities, confirming the divisibility.

The critical insight is recognizing the determinant's alternating nature and leveraging linear dependencies modulo primes to establish divisibility by \( 2015! \).
