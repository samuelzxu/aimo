Okay, let's break down the problem step by step. We need to find the time-0 price of a contingent claim that pays \( S(1)^\alpha \) at time 1, given some parameters. The key steps involve understanding the Black-Scholes framework, risk-neutral valuation, and using the given information to solve for the unknown constant \(\alpha\).

1. **Given Parameters**:
   - \( S(0) = 0.5 \)
   - Stock price dynamics: \( \frac{dS(t)}{S(t)} = 0.05 dt + 0.2 dZ(t) \)
   - \( E[S(1)^\alpha] = 1.4 \) (under the real-world measure)
   - Risk-free rate \( r = 0.03 \)

2. **Risk-Neutral Measure Adjustment**:
   - The stock's drift under the real-world measure is 0.05, and the risk-free rate is 0.03. Using Girsanov's theorem, we adjust the drift to the risk-free rate. The market price of risk \( \theta \) is \( (0.05 - 0.03)/0.2 = 0.1 \).

3. **Solving for \(\alpha\)**:
   - The expectation \( E[S(1)^\alpha] = 1.4 \) under the real-world measure can be expressed using the log-normal distribution properties of \( S(1) \). This leads to solving the equation:
     \[
     (0.5)^\alpha \exp\left( \alpha \cdot 0.05 + 0.5 \cdot \alpha (\alpha - 1) \cdot 0.04 \right) = 1.4
     \]
   - Solving this equation, we find \(\alpha = -0.5\).

4. **Risk-Neutral Expectation**:
   - Using the risk-neutral measure, we calculate the expected value of \( S(1)^{-0.5} \). This involves adjusting the real-world expectation using the Radon-Nikodym derivative and Girsanov's theorem, leading to:
     \[
     E^Q[S(1)^{-0.5}] = 1.4 \cdot \exp(0.01)
     \]

5. **Time-0 Price Calculation**:
   - The time-0 price is the discounted risk-neutral expectation:
     \[
     e^{-0.03} \cdot 1.4 \cdot \exp(0.01) = 1.4 \cdot \exp(-0.02)
     \]
   - Approximating \( \exp(-0.02) \approx 0.9802 \), the price is approximately \( 1.4 \cdot 0.9802 \approx 1.3723 \), which rounds to 1.37.

The final answer is determined by recognizing the need to adjust the real-world expectation to the risk-neutral measure and using the given parameters to solve for \(\alpha\). The key steps involve understanding measure changes and applying the Black-Scholes framework correctly.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 1: <keep>First, the stock price follows the Black-Scholes model, so the dynamics are given by equation (ii): dS(t)/S(t) = 0.05dt + 0.2dZ(t).</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 2: <keep>Here, Z(t) is a standard Brownian motion.</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 3: <keep>The initial stock price S(0) is 0.5.</keep>

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 5: <keep>We also know that E[S(1)^α] = 1.4, where α is a negative constant.</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 6: <keep>Our task is to find the time-0 price of a contingent claim that pays S(1)^α at time 1.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 1: <keep>In the Black-Scholes framework, the price of a contingent claim is the expected discounted payoff under the risk-neutral measure.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 2: <keep>However, here they provided the expectation under the real-world measure, since the drift given in (ii) is 0.05, which is likely different from the risk-free rate.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 1: <keep>The market price of risk θ is (μ - r)/σ, where μ is the real-world drift (0.05), r is the risk-free rate (0.03), and σ is the volatility (0.2).</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 2: <keep>So θ = (0.05 - 0.03)/0.2 = 0.02 / 0.2 = 0.1.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 3: <keep>Then, by Girsanov's theorem, under the risk-neutral measure, the Brownian motion Z(t) becomes Z*(t) = Z(t) + θ t.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 4: <keep>Therefore, the dynamics of S(t) under the risk-neutral measure would be:</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 5: <keep>dS(t)/S(t) = (μ - σ θ) dt + σ dZ*(t) = (0.05 - 0.2 * 0.1) dt + 0.2 dZ*(t) = (0.05 - 0.02) dt + 0.2 dZ*(t) = 0.03 dt + 0.2 dZ*(t)</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 1: <keep>But our task is to price the contingent claim, which is the discounted expectation under the risk-neutral measure.</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 2: <keep>However, the problem gives us E[S(1)^α] = 1.4 under the real-world measure.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 1: <keep>Let me recall that in the Black-Scholes model, if S(t) follows a geometric Brownian motion, then S(t)^α is log-normally distributed as well.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 2: <keep>Because if S(t) = S(0) exp( (μ - 0.5 σ^2)t + σ Z(t)), then S(t)^α = S(0)^α exp( α(μ - 0.5 σ^2)t + α σ Z(t)).</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 3: <keep>Which is another log-normal variable with drift α(μ - 0.5 σ^2)t and volatility α σ.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 4: <keep>Therefore, the expectation of S(t)^α under the real-world measure would be E[S(t)^α] = S(0)^α exp( α μ t - 0.5 α σ^2 t + 0.5 α^2 σ^2 t )</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 1: <keep>Given that E^P [S(1)^α] = 1.4, we could perhaps express E^P [S(1)^{α - 0.5} } in terms of E^P [S(1)^α} multiplied by some factors.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 1: <keep>Using the quadratic formula, we solve for α and find that α ≈ -0.5.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 2: <keep>Since α is negative, the valid solution is α = -0.5.</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 1: <keep>Now that we found α = -0.5, we can compute the time-0 price of the contingent claim which is e^{-0.03} * 1.4 * exp(-0.02 * (-0.5)) = e^{-0.03} * 1.4 * exp(0.01).</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 2: <keep>This simplifies to 1.4 * exp(-0.02).</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 1: <keep>Calculating exp(-0.02) ≈ 0.9802, the time-0 price ≈ 1.4 * 0.9802 ≈ 1.3723.</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 2: <keep>Thus, the final answer is approximately 1.37.</keep>
