Alright, let's break down the problem step by step. The question is about determining the activity of alpha decay after 10 minutes for a radioactive nucleus that can decay via both alpha and beta-minus emissions. Here's the thought process:

1. **Understand the Problem**: We have nucleus X decaying into Y (alpha decay) with a half-life of 3 minutes and into Q (beta decay) with a half-life of 0.098 minutes. The initial number of X nuclei is 5×10³⁴. We need the activity of alpha decay after 10 minutes.

2. **Decay Constants Calculation**:
   - **Alpha Decay Constant (λ_α)**: Calculated using λ = ln(2)/T₁/₂. For T₁/₂ = 3 minutes, λ_α = 0.231 min⁻¹.
   - **Beta Decay Constant (λ_β)**: Similarly, for T₁/₂ = 0.098 minutes, λ_β = 7.073 min⁻¹.
   - **Total Decay Constant (λ_total)**: Sum of λ_α and λ_β ≈ 7.304 min⁻¹.

3. **Remaining Nuclei After 10 Minutes**:
   - Using the exponential decay formula N(t) = N₀ × e^(-λ_total × t).
   - Plugging in the values: N(10) = 5×10³⁴ × e^(-73.04) ≈ 9.42×10².

4. **Activity Calculation**:
   - Activity A = λ × N(t). For alpha decay, A_α = λ_α × N(t).
   - Convert λ_α to per second: 0.231 min⁻¹ ≈ 0.00385 s⁻¹.
   - Activity A_α ≈ 0.00385 s⁻¹ × 942 ≈ 3.62 Bq.

5. **Answer Selection**:
   - The closest answer choice to the calculated value of ~3.6 Bq is option B (3.719 Bq), considering possible approximations and rounding during calculations.

**Critical Tokens for Future Reasoning**:
- Decay constants for both alpha and beta decay.
- Total decay constant as the sum of individual constants.
- Exponential decay formula and its application.
- Conversion of decay constants from per minute to per second.
- Activity formula focusing on alpha decay specifically.
