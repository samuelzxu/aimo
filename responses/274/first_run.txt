Okay, let's go through the problem again to make sure I didn't miss anything. The question is asking for the electron number density at equilibrium when both ionizers are on. From previous knowledge, equilibrium means the rate of electron production equals the rate of recombination. Each ionizer contributes to the production, so their rates should add up. Recombination depends on the square of the electron density. So combining these gives a quadratic equation, leading to the square root of the total ionization rates over the recombination coefficient. Examples checked out, so the answer seems solid.

To optimize the reasoning trace by identifying essential tokens for future steps, the following tokens should be wrapped with `<keep>` tags:

- **Paragraph 2, Sentence 2**: <keep>At equilibrium, the rate of ionization should balance the rate of recombination.</keep>  
- **Paragraph 3, Sentence 2**: <keep>Recombination typically follows a term proportional to \( n_e^2 \) because it's a process where an electron and an ion recombine, which depends on the product of their densities.</keep>  
- **Paragraph 4, Sentence 1**: <keep>the equilibrium condition is:</keep>  
- **Paragraph 4, Sentence 2**: <keep>\( Q_1 + Q_2 = \alpha n_e^2 \)</keep>  
- **Paragraph 5, Sentence 1**: <keep>Therefore, solving for \( n_e \), we get:</keep>  
- **Paragraph 5, Sentence 2**: <keep>\( n_e = \sqrt{\frac{Q_1 + Q_2}{\alpha}} \)</keep>  
- **Paragraph 10, Sentence 1**: <keep>the equilibrium density when both ionizers are on would be determined by equating the total ionization rate (sum of the two) to the recombination rate.</keep>  

These selections capture the core equations, critical reasoning steps, and the final conclusion necessary for sustaining the logical flow in subsequent reasoning.
