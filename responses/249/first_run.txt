Okay, let me try to figure out how to apply the <keep> tags here. The user wants me to mark essential tokens that are crucial for future reasoning steps. The problem has two parts, each involving PDE analysis.

First, looking at part (1): The key steps involve differentiating N(t) and substituting the PDE. The critical parts here are the derivation of dN/dt, the integration by parts steps, and the resulting differential inequality. The equations where N(t) is expressed in terms of u(t) and the resulting differential equation are vital. Also, the conclusion that u1 >1 leads to exponential growth in N(t) is essential.

For example, the section where dN/dt is calculated using integration by parts and the substitution of the PDE is crucial. The integral expressions and the resulting terms like u(t) P(t) - N(t) + ρ(t,0) must be kept. The reasoning around the differential inequality dN/dt ≥ (u1 -1) N(t) is key for the conclusion.

In part (2), the analysis involves the convergence of the joint distribution to uniformity in x. The discussion about Fourier modes and hypocoercivity is important. The equations for the Fourier modes, the energy estimates, and the application of hypocoercivity theory are essential. The connection to the kinetic Fokker-Planck equation and the decay of non-zero modes should be kept.

Key points here are the PDE decomposition into Fourier modes, the energy estimate for ||p_k||, and the conclusion that non-zero modes decay. The role of velocity diffusion and drift in homogenizing spatial distribution must be highlighted.

I need to mark all these crucial equations and reasoning steps with <keep> tags. The PDEs, integral expressions, key inequalities, and hypocoercivity arguments are all necessary for future steps. Also, the final conclusions about unbounded N(t) and spatial homogenization must be included.
