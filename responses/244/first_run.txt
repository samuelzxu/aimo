Okay, let's start breaking down this problem step by step. The user wants to find the vector p that results from projecting vectors a and b onto some vector v, with the condition that a, b, and p are collinear. 

First, I recall that the projection of a vector x onto v is given by (x⋅v/||v||²)v. Since both projections equal p, we have proj_v(a) = proj_v(b) = p. This means the scalar multiples (from the dot products) must be equal when projecting both a and b onto v. 

Next, since a, b, and p are collinear, p must be a scalar multiple of both a and b. However, checking a and b, they aren't scalar multiples of each other. For example, a's components don't scale to match b's. This implies the only possible collinear vector p they can both project to is the zero vector because the zero vector is technically collinear with any vector.

Considering projections onto v resulting in zero, both a and b must be orthogonal to v. In 3D space, if a and b aren't parallel, their cross product gives a vector orthogonal to both. Calculating a × b yields [-6, 0, 3], which is orthogonal to a and b. Using this v, projections of a and b onto v are zero, making p the zero vector. 

This satisfies all conditions: p is collinear with a and b (as the zero vector), and the projections are consistent. Thus, the answer is the zero vector.
