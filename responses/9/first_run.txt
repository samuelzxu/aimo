Okay, so I need to figure out which parts of the reasoning are essential to keep for future steps. Let me go through the Deepseek Thinking Trajectory step by step.

First, the user starts by visualizing the square and triangle. They assign coordinates to the square, which is crucial for setting up the problem. Points A, I, M, E are placed at specific coordinates, establishing the layout. Then, they identify that EM is the vertical side of the square, which is important since the triangle's base is EM.

Next, they figure out that the triangle GEM is isosceles with base EM. The key insight here is determining the coordinates of point G, which must be horizontally offset from EM. The calculation showing that the y-coordinate of G must be 5 (midpoint of EM) is essential for determining the triangle's shape.

Then, the user considers whether the triangle is inside or outside the square. They realize that if G is inside the square (h ≤10), the overlapping area would be too small, leading them to conclude that G must be outside (h >10). This part is critical because it changes how the overlapping area is calculated.

They then derive the equations of lines GE and GM, which form the triangle's sides. These equations are necessary for calculating the intersection points with the square's left edge (x=0). The intersection points at (0, 50/h) and (0, 10 -50/h) are key to determining the overlapping region.

The user then sets up the integral to compute the overlapping area, which leads to the equation 100 - 500/h = 80. Solving for h gives h=25, which is the altitude. The verification by plugging h=25 back into the equations and checking the area confirms the solution.

Each of these steps contains essential tokens: coordinate setup, equations for lines GE and GM, intersection points, area integral setup, and the final equation solving for h. These parts must be kept for future reasoning, especially the mathematical derivations and the critical realizations about the triangle's position relative to the square.
