Okay, I need to identify the essential tokens in the reasoning trace that are necessary for future steps. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, the analysis of option [A] involves understanding that irreversible compression against constant pressure p1 results in maximum work done on the gas. The key points here are comparing irreversible vs. reversible processes, using examples with specific pressures and volumes, and concluding that irreversible compression does more work. Important tokens here include the work calculation formulas and the conclusion that [A] is correct.

For option [B], the critical part is recognizing that free expansion is both adiabatic (Q=0) and isothermal (ΔU=0 for ideal gas), leading to the correctness of [B]. The explanation about internal energy and temperature is essential here.

Option [C] compares adiabatic and isothermal expansions. The vital part is the comparison of work done using the area under P-V curves, concluding that adiabatic work is less. Formulas for work in both processes and the conclusion that [C] is correct are key.

Option [D] involves the change in internal energy. The reasoning shows that part (ii) is incorrect because adiabatic expansion leads to a decrease in internal energy. The crucial tokens here are the relationship between ΔU, work, and temperature change.

Now, I need to mark the exact tokens using <keep> tags without altering the text.

Looking at the structure:

1. For [A], the examples with calculations and the conclusion that irreversible work is higher are essential.
2. For [B], the explanation about free expansion being both adiabatic and isothermal is crucial.
3. For [C], the comparison of work done between adiabatic and isothermal processes.
4. For [D], the discussion on internal energy change being negative in part (ii).

I need to ensure each marked section is a complete phrase or sentence directly from the reasoning.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 4: <keep>Work done on the gas is the area under the P-V curve, right?</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 1: <keep>Since the external pressure is constant, the work done would be W = -P_ext * ΔV.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 5: <keep>In that case, the work done in reversible compression is the maximum possible work because you're always opposing the maximum possible external pressure.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 3: <keep>Work done on the gas is P_ext*(V2 - V1).</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 1: <keep>For example, in the example, the isothermal reversible compression requires less work than the irreversible compression against constant p1.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 3: <keep>So according to this example, the irreversible work (2 L·atm) is higher than the reversible work (1.386 L·atm).</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, in that case, even though it's irreversible, the work done on the gas is less.</keep>
- Paragraph 15, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, in that case, the work done on the gas is higher when compressed irreversibly.</keep>
- Paragraph 17, Sentence 1: <keep>If the expansion is carried out freely, it is simultaneously both isothermal as well as adiabatic.</keep>
- Paragraph 17, Sentence 5: <keep>Therefore, free expansion is both adiabatic (Q=0) and isothermal (T constant).</keep>
- Paragraph 18, Sentence 1: <keep>"The work done by the gas is less when it is expanded reversibly from V1 to V2 under adiabatic conditions as compared to that when expanded reversibly from V1 to V2 under isothermal conditions."</keep>
- Paragraph 18, Sentence 3: <keep>Therefore, work done by gas is less in adiabatic compared to isothermal.</keep>
- Paragraph 19, Sentence 1: <keep>Work done by gas in isothermal reversible expansion: W_iso = nRT ln(V2/V1).</keep>
- Paragraph 19, Sentence 4: <keep>Therefore, work done by gas in adiabatic is less than isothermal.</keep>
- Paragraph 20, Sentence 1: <keep>"The change in internal energy of the gas is (i) zero, if it is expanded reversibly with T1=T2, and (ii) positive, if it is expanded reversibly under adiabatic conditions with T1≠T2."</keep>
- Paragraph 20, Sentence 5: <keep>But the statement claims positive. Therefore, part (ii) is wrong.</keep>
- Paragraph 21, Sentence 1: <keep>Hence, correct options are [A], [B], [C].</keep>
