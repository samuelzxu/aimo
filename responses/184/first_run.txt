Alright, let's break down the problem. We need to find the remainder when the tenth smallest element of set T is divided by 1000. Set T is derived from set S, which contains perfect squares ending with 256. Truncating the last three digits (256) of each element in S gives us T. 

First, I analyzed the modular conditions for squares ending in 256. Solving n² ≡ 256 mod 1000, I broke it down using the Chinese Remainder Theorem into modulo 8 and 125. For modulo 8, n must be 0 mod 4. For modulo 125, solving n² ≡ 6 mod 125 gives solutions n ≡ 16 or 109 mod 125. Combining these with n ≡ 0 mod 4, we find n ≡ 16 mod 500 or 484 mod 500.

Next, I determined the elements of T by expressing them as (n² - 256)/1000. This results in two sequences: 250m² + 16m (for n = 500m + 16) and 250k² - 16k (for n = 500k - 16). Generating terms from both sequences and merging them in ascending order, the tenth smallest element is found to be 6170. 

Finally, calculating 6170 mod 1000 gives the remainder 170.
