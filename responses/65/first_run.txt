Alright, I need to figure out how many ordered triples (a, 1995, c) exist such that a right rectangular prism with sides a ≤ 1995 ≤ c can be cut by a plane parallel to one of its faces into two prisms, one of which is similar to the original. 

First, I recall that similarity requires the sides of the smaller prism to be proportional to the original. If we cut along the c-axis, the resulting prism would have dimensions (a, 1995, c1). For similarity, the ratios of the sides must match the original, possibly in a different order. 

Considering the problem, after cutting along the c-axis, the new prism must have sides that are a permutation of the original scaled by a factor. This leads to the equation c * c1 = 1995². Each valid divisor a of 1995², where a ≤ 1995, gives a valid ordered triple (a, 1995, 1995²/a).

The number of such ordered triples is determined by the number of divisors of 1995² that are less than or equal to 1995. Factoring 1995, we get 1995 = 3 * 5 * 7 * 19. Hence, 1995² has (2+1)⁴ = 81 divisors. Since divisors come in pairs (d, 1995²/d), half of these (excluding 1995 itself) are less than or equal to 1995. This results in (81 - 1)/2 = 40 valid ordered triples.
