To determine the number of ordered triples \((a, 1995, c)\) such that a right rectangular prism with sides \(a \leq 1995 \leq c\) can be cut by a plane parallel to one of its faces into two prisms, one of which is similar to the original, we need to consider the conditions for similarity and the integral lengths of the sides.

1. **Understanding Similarity**: For a prism to be similar after a cut, the ratios of its sides must remain proportional. This implies that if the original prism has sides \(a, 1995, c\), the smaller prism must have sides that are a scalar multiple of these dimensions.

2. **Cutting Along the \(c\)-axis**: When cutting along the \(c\)-axis, the new prism dimensions would be \(a, 1995, kc\) for some \(k < 1\). For similarity, the ratio \( \frac{a}{1995} = \frac{1995}{c} \) must hold, leading to the equation \( a \cdot c = 1995^2 \).

3. **Divisors of \(1995^2\)**: The equation \( a \cdot c = 1995^2 \) implies that \(a\) must be a divisor of \(1995^2\). The prime factorization of 1995 is \(3 \times 5 \times 7 \times 19\), so \(1995^2 = 3^2 \times 5^2 \times 7^2 \times 19^2\). The number of divisors of \(1995^2\) is \((2+1)^4 = 81\).

4. **Counting Valid Divisors**: Since \(a \leq 1995\), we need to count the divisors of \(1995^2\) that are less than or equal to 1995. Each divisor \(a\) pairs with a corresponding divisor \(c = \frac{1995^2}{a}\) which is greater than or equal to 1995. The number of such pairs is \(\frac{81 - 1}{2} = 40\), excluding the case where \(a = 1995\) (which results in a cube and is counted separately).

Thus, the number of valid ordered triples \((a, 1995, c)\) is \(\boxed{40}\).
