Okay, I need to identify which parts of the reasoning are essential for future steps. Let's go through each paragraph and see which sentences hold key information.

Starting with the first paragraph: The user recalls that real and even signals have real Fourier transforms, and real and odd signals have imaginary ones. This is crucial because it sets up the core reasoning.

Second paragraph: The user analyzes x1(t), determining it's odd because sin is odd and the interval is symmetric. This conclusion is vital as it directly leads to the Fourier transform being imaginary.

Third paragraph: The user confirms the signal's oddness and connects it to the Fourier transform being imaginary. Reiterating the conclusion here solidifies the reasoning.

Fourth paragraph: Writing out the Fourier transform equation is a step, but the key is substituting Euler's formula for sin. This substitution is necessary for the integration steps.

Fifth paragraph: Simplifying the exponentials and integrating each term is detailed math, but the essential part is the substitution and how it breaks into separate integrals.

The following paragraphs about integrating each term and simplifying involve calculations. However, the critical point is that after integration, the expression includes a factor of -j, making it purely imaginary. This result is fundamental.

The later paragraphs where the user confirms the oddness again and discusses the properties of real and odd signals reinforce the conclusion without adding new info. The final summary that x1(t) being odd leads to an imaginary transform is essential.

Important parts are the initial premise about real/odd signals, the substitution using Euler's formula, integration leading to the -j factor, and the conclusion based on signal properties.
