Okay, let's break down the problem step by step. The question is asking which star would appear redder than it would if it were located next to the Sun, given that all stars have the same parallax and radial velocity. The key here is understanding how interstellar reddening (caused by dust) affects the observed color of the stars.

First, same parallax means all stars are at the same distance from us. Radial velocity (RV) affects Doppler shift, but since all have the same RV, the Doppler effect is uniform and doesn't differentiate between them. Therefore, the main factor causing a star to appear redder than its intrinsic color is interstellar reddening, which depends on the amount of dust along the line of sight.

Galactic coordinates (l and b) are crucial. Lower galactic latitude (b closer to 0°) means the star is closer to the Galactic plane, where dust density is higher. Star1 has the lowest |b| at 1°, indicating it's in a dust-rich region. Star4 has b=10°, Star3 at 15°, and Star2 at 20°. Thus, Star1 likely experiences the most extinction (E(B-V)), leading to the highest reddening.

Teff (effective temperature) determines intrinsic color: cooler stars (lower Teff) are intrinsically redder. However, the question isn't about intrinsic color but the difference caused by reddening. Even a hotter star (higher Teff) with significant reddening can appear redder than its intrinsic color when compared to its hypothetical nearby position (no dust).

Metallicity ([Fe/H]) and surface gravity (logg) influence intrinsic color but don't affect interstellar reddening. Since the problem doesn't link these parameters to dust distribution, they can be ignored for reddening calculation.

In conclusion, Star1's low galactic latitude (b=1°) implies the highest dust exposure, leading to the most significant reddening. Thus, Star1 (option C) will appear redder than if it were next to the Sun.
