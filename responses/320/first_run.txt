Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine the maximum value of the ratio AP/PE where ABC is a lattice triangle with exactly one interior lattice point P, and E is the intersection of AP with BC.

First, recall Pick's Theorem, which relates the area of a lattice polygon to its interior and boundary lattice points. For a triangle with exactly one interior point (I=1), Pick's Theorem states that Area = 1 + B/2 - 1 = B/2. Here, B is the number of boundary lattice points.

To maximize AP/PE, we need a configuration where E is as close as possible to P, making PE small while AP remains large. Consider right triangles with vertices at (0, k), (0, 0), and (m, 0) where m and k are integers. 

By analyzing such triangles:
1. For m=2 and k=4, the triangle has vertices at (0,4), (0,0), and (2,0). The only interior lattice point is (1,1).
2. The line AP from (0,4) to (1,1) intersects BC at (4/3, 0).
3. Calculate AP and PE:
   - AP = √[(1-0)² + (1-4)²] = √(1 + 9) = √10
   - PE = √[(4/3-1)² + (0-1)²] = √[(1/3)² + 1] = √(1/9 + 1) = √(10/9) = √10/3
   - Ratio AP/PE = √10 / (√10/3) = 3

Thus, the maximum ratio achievable is 3. After verifying other configurations and ensuring no higher ratio exists, we conclude the maximum ratio is indeed 3.
