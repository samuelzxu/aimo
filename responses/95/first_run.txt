Okay, let's go through the problem step by step. We need to find how many segments PₖQₖ have rational lengths in triangle ABC with given side lengths. The key steps involve coordinate geometry, similarity, and analyzing the conditions for rational lengths.

1. **Triangle ABC Coordinates**:
   - Placing A at (0,0), B at (9,0), and determining coordinates of C using distance formulas.
   - Solving for C's coordinates using distances AC=12 and BC=5√3 leads to C=(25/3, √671/3).

2. **Segment Parallelism**:
   - Each segment PₖQₖ is parallel to BC. Points Pₖ and Qₖ are uniformly divided along AB and AC into 2450 segments.
   - Calculating vector PₖQₖ shows it's a scalar multiple of vector BC, confirming parallelism.

3. **Length Calculation**:
   - The length of each segment PₖQₖ is proportional to k/2450 times the length of BC.
   - BC length is 5√3, so PₖQₖ length becomes (5√3k)/2450 = (√3k)/490.

4. **Rational Length Condition**:
   - For (√3k)/490 to be rational, √3k must be rational. Since √3 is irrational, k must make √3k rational, which is impossible for integer k between 1 and 2449.

**Conclusion**: No valid k satisfies the rational length condition, hence the answer is 0.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 1: <keep>Triangle $ABC$ has side lengths $AB = 9$ , $BC =$ $5\sqrt{3}$ , and $AC = 12$ . Points $A = P_{0}, P_{1}, P_{2}, ... , P_{2450} = B$ are on segment $\overline{AB}$ with $P_{k}$ between $P_{k-1}$ and $P_{k+1}$ for $k = 1, 2, ..., 2449$ , and points $A = Q_{0}, Q_{1}, Q_{2}, ... , Q_{2450} = C$ are on segment $\overline{AC}$ with $Q_{k}$ between $Q_{k-1}$ and $Q_{k+1}$ for $k = 1, 2, ..., 2449$ . Furthermore, each segment $\overline{P_{k}Q_{k}}$ , $k = 1, 2, ..., 2449$ , is parallel to $\overline{BC}$ .</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 1: <keep>First, let me visualize triangle ABC. Let me sketch it in my mind. AB is 9 units long, AC is 12 units, and BC is 5√3. Hmm, the sides are interesting. Maybe it's a right triangle? Let me check using the Pythagorean theorem.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 1: <keep>Using Heron's formula: The sides are a = BC = 5√3, b = AC = 12, c = AB = 9.</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 1: <keep>Let me place point A at the origin (0,0). Then AB is from (0,0) to (9,0). AC is from (0,0) to some point (maybe it's not along the x-axis, since ABC isn't a right triangle), but if I place A at (0,0), B at (9,0), and C somewhere in the plane. Let’s try coordinates.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 1: <keep>Compute the semi-perimeter: s = (9 + 12 + 5√3)/2 = (21 + 5√3)/2.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 1: <keep>Let’s set coordinates: Let point A = (0,0), point B = (9,0). Then point C is somewhere such that AC = 12 and BC = 5√3. So coordinates of C are (x,y), with distance from A being 12, so x2 + y2 = 144, and distance from B(9,0) to C(x,y) is 5√3, so (x-9)^2 + y^2 = (5√3)^2 = 75.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 1: <keep>Thus, subtract the two equations: (x-9)^2 + y^2 - (x2 + y2) = 75 - 144 ⇒ (x2 -18x +81) + y2 - x2 - y2 = -69 ⇒ -18x + 81 = -69 ⇒ -18x = -150 ⇒ x = 150/18 = 25/3 ≈ 8.333...</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 1: <keep>Then x = 25/3. Then from x2 + y2 = 144: (25/3)^2 + y2 = 144 ⇒ 625/9 + y2 = 1296/9 ⇒ y2 = (1296 - 625)/9 = 671/9 ⇒ y = √(671)/3.</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, coordinate C is (25/3, √671/3).</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 1: <keep>Now, points P_k divide AB into 2450 segments, from A (P0) to B (P2450), so each step along AB is length 9/2450 per segment. Similarly, points Q_k divide AC into 2450 segments from A (Q0) to C (Q2450).</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentence 1: <keep>But since the segments P_kQ_k are parallel to BC, which is the key here. So for each k, the segment P_kQ_k is parallel to BC, so the triangles AP_kQ_k are similar to triangle ABC, with similarity factor depending on k.</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 1: <keep>Using Heron's formula: The sides are a = BC = 5√3, b = AC = 12, c = AB = 9.</keep>
- Paragraph 14, Sentence 1: <keep>Compute the semi-perimeter: s = (9 + 12 + 5√3)/2 = (21 + 5√3)/2.</keep>
- Paragraph 15, Sentence 1: <keep>Compute area using the shoelace formula: A(0,0), B(9,0), C(25/3, √671/3).</keep>
- Paragraph 16, Sentence 1: <keep>Area of triangle ABC: (1/2)*(9√671 / 3) = (3√671)/2.</keep>
- Paragraph 17, Sentence 1: <keep>The segments cut the triangle into 2450 regions, each with area = total area / 2450.</keep>
- Paragraph 18, Sentence 1: <keep>Using similarity of triangles APkQk and ABC: The ratio of similarity is k/2450, so the length of PkQk is BC*(k/2450) = 5√3*(k/2450).</keep>
- Paragraph 19, Sentence 1: <keep>Length of PkQk is (5√3k)/2450 = (√3k)/490.</keep>
- Paragraph 20, Sentence 1: <keep>For rational length, (√3k)/490 must be rational. Since √3 is irrational, no integer k makes this rational.</keep>
- Paragraph 21, Sentence 1: <keep>Thus, the number of segments with rational lengths is zero.</keep>
