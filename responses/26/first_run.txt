Okay, I need to go through the reasoning process and determine which parts are essential for future steps. Let's start by breaking down each paragraph and sentence to see which tokens are crucial.

1. **Question and Context**: The question details the combustion of Hg(g) in a calorimeter. Essential info here includes the number of moles (2 mol Hg), temperature change (298K to 312.8K), calorimeter heat capacity (20.00 kJ/K), and enthalpy of formation of Hg(g) (61.32 kJ/mol). These values are necessary for initial calculations, so they should be kept.

2. **Balanced Chemical Equation**: The reaction 2 Hg(g) + O₂(g) → 2 HgO(s) is fundamental. This stoichiometry is needed to relate moles of reactants and products, so this equation must be retained.

3. **Heat Calculation (q_v)**: The formula q_v = C_cal * ΔT and the resulting calculation (20.00 kJ/K * 14.8 K = 296 kJ) are critical. The sign convention (exothermic reaction) and ΔU = -296 kJ are also key here.

4. **Relation Between ΔH and ΔU**: The equation ΔH = ΔU + Δ(n_gas)RT is essential. The computation of Δ(n_gas) = -3 and subsequent substitution of R (8.3 J/K/mol) and T (298 K) leading to ΔH = -303.42 kJ must be kept as they convert internal energy to enthalpy.

5. **Adjustment for Hg State**: The enthalpy required to convert 2 mol Hg(l) to Hg(g) (2 * 61.32 kJ = 122.64 kJ) and its impact on the total ΔH when combined with the reaction's ΔH is vital. This adjustment corrects the initial assumption from Hg(g) to Hg(l), which is necessary for finding the standard molar enthalpy.

6. **Final Calculation**: Combining ΔH values (-303.42 kJ + 122.64 kJ = -180.78 kJ) and dividing by 2 for per mole basis gives -90.39 kJ/mol. This final step's mathematical operations and conclusion are crucial.

Each of these steps contains specific data and equations that directly influence the final answer. Omitting any could lead to errors in subsequent calculations. The key is to ensure all necessary values (like 2 mol Hg, 20.00 kJ/K, ΔT=14.8K, Δ(n_gas)=-3, R=8.3 J/K/mol, T=298K, 61.32 kJ/mol) and critical equations (q_v, ΔH=ΔU+ΔnRT, and enthalpy adjustment) are preserved.
