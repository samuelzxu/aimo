Okay, I need to identify which parts of the reasoning are crucial for determining the total number of weights in the first layer. Let's start by looking at the key steps the user took.

The user considered the structure of the convolutional layer: input size, filter size, number of filters, stride, and padding. However, the key factors here are the filter size (5x5), input channels (1), and number of filters (4). These are essential because the total weights are calculated as 5*5*1*4=100. 

The user also discussed whether biases should be included. The conclusion was that "weights" typically refer to the filter parameters, not biases. This distinction is important to exclude the 4 bias terms, solidifying 100 as the answer. 

The sections where the user calculates the formula (5*5*1*4) and clarifies the inclusion of only weights are critical. These parts must be kept for future steps to reference the calculation method and the reasoning behind excluding biases.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 3: <keep>each filter has 5x5x1 weights. Then, since there are 4 such filters, the total number of weights would be 4 * 5 * 5 * 1</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 11: <keep>4 * 5 *5 *1=100</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 17: <keep>the answer should be \boxed{100}</keep>
