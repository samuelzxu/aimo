Okay, I need to figure out which parts of the existing reasoning are essential for future steps. Let's go through each paragraph and see.

1. The first paragraph introduces the problem. The key points here are the series structure and the use of the trigonometric identity for sin^3(x). The identity formula is crucial because it transforms the series into a telescoping one. So, I should keep the identity and how it's applied.

2. In the next paragraph, substituting the identity into the series term is vital. The transformed term becomes a telescoping difference, which is central to solving the problem. The expression after substitution and the realization that it telescopes must be kept.

3. The example terms for n=1, n=2, and n=3 demonstrate how the telescoping works. However, the exact calculations for each n might not be needed again once the telescoping pattern is established. But the structure showing cancellation is important, so maybe keep a part of that explanation.

4. The discussion on the telescoping sum and the limit as N approaches infinity is critical. The conclusion that only the first term and the limit term remain is essential. The limit calculation showing that it approaches 3π must be retained.

5. The recap confirming that S equals 3π/4 is crucial. The arithmetic leading to 100 * 3π/4 = 75π and the approximation to 235.619 is necessary for the final answer.

6. The verification with partial sums for N=1 to N=5 shows convergence, but once the telescoping is proven, this might be redundant. However, the conclusion that partial sums approach 3π/4 reinforces the result and is worth keeping.

7. The final calculation steps where 75π is approximated and rounded to 236 are essential for the answer.

I need to ensure that each kept block includes complete sentences or phrases without alteration. Let me mark the key formulas, the telescoping transformation, the limit evaluation, and the final approximation steps.
