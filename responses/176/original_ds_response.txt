Okay, so I need to figure out how many functions f: {0,1}^3 → {0,1} are monotonic. Monotonic here means that if you have two ordered triples (a1, a2, a3) and (b1, b2, b3) where each ai is greater than or equal to bi, then f(a1, a2, a3) is greater than or equal to f(b1, b2, b3). 

First off, let me make sure I understand the problem. The domain is all 3-bit binary numbers, so there are 8 possible inputs. Each of these inputs maps to either 0 or 1. We need to count how many such mappings preserve the monotonicity property. That is, if one input is component-wise greater than or equal to another, then the output of the first input must be greater than or equal to the output of the second.

So, in simpler terms, if I have two binary triples, say A and B, and every bit in A is at least as big as the corresponding bit in B, then the function's value at A should be at least as big as its value at B. Because the outputs are just 0 or 1, this means that if A is component-wise greater than or equal to B, then f(A) can't be 0 if f(B) is 1. In other words, if A >= B, f(A) >= f(B), which in binary terms would translate to f(A) can't be less than f(B). So if f(B) is 1, then f(A) must also be 1. If f(A) is 0, then f(B) must also be 0.

Okay, so to count such functions, maybe I can approach this by considering the structure of the hypercube {0,1}^3. Since it's a 3-dimensional hypercube, it has a lattice structure where each node is a 3-bit binary number, and edges connect nodes that differ in exactly one bit. Monotonic functions would correspond to functions that don't decrease as you go up the lattice from the all-0s vector to the all-1s vector. 

In one dimension (n=1), {0,1} has two points. A monotonic function f: {0,1} → {0,1} must have f(0) ≤ f(1). So possible functions are either constant 0, constant 1, or f(0)=0 and f(1)=1. Wait, but if it's from {0,1} to {0,1}, the only possibilities are the two constant functions and the identity function? Wait, no. Wait, there are four functions in total:

1. f(0)=0, f(1)=0 (constant 0)
2. f(0)=0, f(1)=1 (identity)
3. f(0)=1, f(1)=0 (negation)
4. f(0)=1, f(1)=1 (constant 1)

Out of these, the monotonic ones are the ones where f(0) ≤ f(1). That is, functions where f(0)=0 and f(1)=1 (identity), constant 0, and constant 1. So that's three monotonic functions? But wait, if you have f(0)=0 and f(1)=0, then f(0) ≤ f(1) since 0 ≤ 0. Similarly, if f(0)=1 and f(1)=1, then 1 ≤ 1. And the identity function where 0 ≤ 1. Wait, actually all functions except the negation function satisfy f(0) ≤ f(1), because 0 ≤ 0, 0 ≤ 1, and 1 ≤ 1. But the negation function has f(0)=1 and f(1)=0, which violates 1 ≤ 0. So actually, in one dimension, the number of monotonic functions is 3? Wait, but that contradicts with my previous thought. Wait let's check: For n=1, over {0,1}, the number of monotonic functions should be the number of order-preserving functions. Since 0 ≤ 1 in the domain, and in the codomain {0,1} with 0 ≤ 1. So the functions must map 0 to ≤ what 1 is mapped to. So:

If f(0) = 0, then f(1) can be 0 or 1.

If f(0) = 1, then f(1) must be 1 (since 1 ≤ f(1) is required).

But wait, in the condition, for all a, b in the domain with a ≤ b, f(a) ≤ f(b). So if a ≤ b, then f(a) ≤ f(b). For n=1, the pairs to check are 0 ≤ 0, which holds for any function since f(0) ≤ f(0), and 0 ≤ 1, so f(0) ≤ f(1), and 1 ≤ 1, so f(1) ≤ f(1). So the only constraint is f(0) ≤ f(1). So for n=1:

Total functions: 4.

Monotonic functions: those where f(0) ≤ f(1). Let's list them:

1. f(0)=0, f(1)=0: 0 ≤ 0, yes.
2. f(0)=0, f(1)=1: 0 ≤ 1, yes.
3. f(0)=1, f(1)=1: 1 ≤ 1, yes.
4. f(0)=1, f(1)=0: 1 ≤ 0, no.

So only three functions. Hence, three monotonic functions for n=1. That makes sense. So for n=1, answer is 3.

But here the problem is for n=3. So I need to generalize this.

I remember that in general, the number of monotonic Boolean functions on n variables is called the Dedekind number, and it's a notoriously difficult problem to compute them. However, Dedekind numbers are only known up to n=8 or 9, and for n=3, the Dedekind number is 20. Wait, but wait. Let me check.

Wait, for n=0, Dedekind number is 2 (since there is one variable, which has two constant functions? Wait no, actually for n=0, there's one function). Wait, maybe my recollection is incorrect.

Wait, actually, the Dedekind number D(n) counts the number of monotonic Boolean functions in n variables. So for n=0, D(0)=2 (constants 0 and 1). For n=1, as we saw, D(1)=3. For n=2, D(2)=6. For n=3, D(3)=20. So if that's the case, then the answer here would be 20. Let me verify this.

Wait, but let me think through it directly. Let's try n=2 first, perhaps manually, to confirm.

For n=2, functions f: {0,1}^2 → {0,1}. There are 16 possible functions, but the monotonic ones must satisfy that if (a1, a2) ≥ (b1, b2), then f(a1,a2) ≥ f(b1,b2).

In the lattice of {0,1}^2, the structure is a square with four elements: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). The order relations are (0,0) ≤ everything, (0,1) ≤ (1,1), (1,0) ≤ (1,1), and (0,1) and (1,0) are incomparable.

So to have a monotonic function, once f(0,0) is chosen, some constraints are placed on f(0,1), f(1,0), and f(1,1). Let's walk through this.

If f(0,0) = 0, then we can set f(0,1) and f(1,0) to 0 or 1, but they have to be ≤ f(1,1). Wait, but also, if f(0,0)=0, then f(0,1) must be >= f(0,0)=0, but since f(0,1) is in {0,1}, it can still be 0 or 1. But if f(0,1) is 1, then f(1,1) must be >= f(0,1), which would mean f(1,1)=1.

Similarly, if f(1,0)=1, then f(1,1)=1. If both f(0,1) and f(1,0) are 1, then f(1,1) must be 1.

If f(0,0)=0, let's think of all possibilities:

Case 1: f(0,0)=0.

Then f(0,1), f(1,0) can be 0 or 1. However:

- If f(0,1)=1, then f(1,1) must be 1.

- If f(1,0)=1, then f(1,1) must be 1.

- If both f(0,1)=1 and f(1,0)=1, then f(1,1)=1.

- If both f(0,1)=0 and f(1,0)=0, then f(1,1) can be 0 or 1.

So let's break down:

Subcases for f(0,1) and f(1,0):

Subcase 1: f(0,1)=0, f(1,0)=0. Then f(1,1) can be 0 or 1 (2 choices).

Subcase 2: f(0,1)=0, f(1,0)=1. Then f(1,1) must be 1 (1 choice).

Subcase 3: f(0,1)=1, f(1,0)=0. Then f(1,1) must be 1 (1 choice).

Subcase 4: f(0,1)=1, f(1,0)=1. Then f(1,1) must be 1 (1 choice).

So total for case 1: 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.

Case 2: f(0,0)=1.

Then, because (0,0) <= all other elements, so all f(0,1), f(1,0), f(1,1) must be >=1. But since the codomain is {0,1}, all outputs must be 1. So f(0,1)=1, f(1,0)=1, f(1,1)=1. Only 1 function here.

So total monotonic functions for n=2: 5 + 1 = 6. Which matches the Dedekind number D(2)=6. So that's good.

Similarly, for n=1, doing the same approach:

If the function is f(0), f(1). If f(0)=0, then f(1) can be 0 or 1. If f(0)=1, then f(1) must be 1. So total functions: 2 + 1 = 3. Which matches.

So for n=3, perhaps the number is 20? If I recall that’s what’s called Dedekind number for n=3. Let's check. But wait, maybe I can think through how to construct it.

But constructing it might be time-consuming. Since this is for n=3, perhaps there is a better way than enumerating all possibilities.

Alternatively, Dedekind numbers count the number of monotonic Boolean functions, or equivalently, the number of antichains in the Boolean lattice, which is the same as the number of elements of the free distributive lattice with n generators, plus two. But I think that's more abstract.

But perhaps instead of dealing with antichains, it's better to realize that Dedekind numbers for n=0 to n=3 are:

n : D(n)

0 : 2

1 : 3

2 : 6

3 : 20

4 : 168

5 : 7581

So yeah, D(3)=20.

Therefore, the answer should be 20, which is the third Dedekind number. However, this problem is asking for functions from {0,1}^3 to {0,1}, so that matches. So the number of such functions is 20.

But wait, before just accepting that, maybe I should at least attempt to compute it for n=3 to verify.

Thinking of the structure again. For {0,1}^3, the cube has 8 vertices. Each vertex can be represented as a binary number from 000 to 111. The monotonicity condition requires that if you have a vertex A and a vertex B where A is component-wise greater than or equal to B, then f(A) ≥ f(B).

In other words, once you set a vertex to 1, all vertices above it (in the component-wise order) must also be 1. Similarly, if you set a vertex to 0, all vertices below it must also be 0. So, the functions can be characterized by the set of minimal elements that are mapped to 1, or the set of maximal elements mapped to 0. Either way, these sets must form an antichain, meaning no two elements are comparable. But the number of antichains doesn't directly map here. Wait, actually in the inclusion of an antichain, but when building the monotonic function, the 1s have to include everything above the minimal 1s, and the 0s include everything below the maximal 0s. So, this is related to upper sets (up-sets) and lower sets. Indeed, a monotonic function is essentially an indicator function of an upper set. Since we have to map to {0,1}, so if we think of the upper set (a subset U of the lattice where if x is in U and x ≤ y, then y is in U), then the characteristic function of U is a monotonic function. Similarly, the complement of a lower set would be an upper set.

But lower sets are subsets where if x is in the set and y ≤ x, then y is in the set. So upper sets are the principal elements here.

Therefore, the number of monotonic functions is equal to the number of upper sets in the Boolean lattice {0,1}^3. This is the same as the Dedekind number D(3). If Dedekind number D(3) is 20, then that's the answer. Wait, but upper sets in the Boolean lattice {0,1}^n are counted by the Dedekind numbers. So since the answer here is D(3), which is 20.

However, Dedekind numbers are sometimes referred to as the number of monotonic Boolean functions, but in the question, they are mapping to {0,1}, so yes, it's exactly the same as the upper sets of the lattice.

Therefore, the answer is 20. Therefore, \boxed{20}.

But to make sure, let's try to calculate it manually perhaps.

In the hypercube {0,1}^3, with 8 elements:

000

001

010

100

011

101

110

111

In terms of the lattice structure, the minimal element is 000, and the maximal element is 111. Each element is connected to those that have exactly one more 1 or one less 1. The upper sets (or up-sets) are subsets where if an element is in the set, then all elements above it are also in the set.

The number of upper sets corresponds to the number of monotonic functions, as previously stated. The Dedekind number D(3) is 20, which counts the number of antichains, which in turn is equal to the number of upper sets because each upper set is uniquely determined by its minimal elements (which form an antichain), and vice versa. Therefore, the number of upper sets is the same as the number of antichains, which is the Dedekind number.

Hence, since D(3) = 20, the answer is 20. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is \boxed{20}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{20}
