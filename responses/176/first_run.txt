Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the number of monotonic functions from the set {0,1}^3 to {0,1}. A function is monotonic if, whenever an input tuple is component-wise greater than or equal to another, the output of the first is greater than or equal to the output of the second. 

First, I need to recall what a monotonic function entails. In simpler terms, if you have two binary triples where each component of the first is at least as large as the corresponding component of the second, then the function's value at the first triple must not be less than its value at the second. Since the outputs are binary (0 or 1), this means that once a function outputs 1 for a certain input, it must output 1 for all inputs that are component-wise greater. Similarly, if a function outputs 0 for an input, it must output 0 for all inputs that are component-wise smaller.

I remember that the number of such monotonic Boolean functions is related to Dedekind numbers. Dedekind numbers count the number of monotonic Boolean functions for a given number of variables. For n=3, the Dedekind number is known to be 20. But to be thorough, let me verify why this is the case.

For n=1, the Dedekind number is 3. For n=2, it's 6. These values make sense when manually checking possible functions. Extending this to n=3, the structure becomes a 3-dimensional hypercube with 8 vertices. Each vertex represents a binary input, and the function must not decrease when moving from a lower vertex to a higher one in the lattice. 

An upper set (or up-set) in this lattice is a set of vertices where if a vertex is in the set, all vertices above it are also included. The number of such upper sets corresponds to the number of monotonic functions. The minimal elements of an upper set form an antichain (a set of elements where none are comparable), and the number of antichains in the Boolean lattice is the Dedekind number. For n=3, this number is indeed 20.

Thus, after confirming the relationship between monotonic functions, upper sets, and Dedekind numbers, I conclude that the number of such functions for n=3 is 20.
