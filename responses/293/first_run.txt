Alright, let's break down the problem step by step. We have two congruent right circular cones with base radius 3 and height 8. Their axes intersect at right angles at a point 3 units from each base. We need to find the maximum radius \( r \) of a sphere that fits inside both cones and compute \( m + n \) where \( r^2 = \frac{m}{n} \).

1. **Understanding the Cone Dimensions**:
   - Each cone has a base radius \( 3 \) and height \( 8 \).
   - The axes intersect 3 units from each base, so the intersection point is \( 8 - 3 = 5 \) units from each apex.

2. **Coordinate System Setup**:
   - Place the first cone along the z-axis with its apex at \( (0, 0, 5) \) and base at \( z = -3 \).
   - Place the second cone along the x-axis with its apex at \( (5, 0, 0) \) and base at \( x = -3 \).

3. **Equation of the Cones**:
   - For the first cone: \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \frac{3}{8}(5 - z) \).
   - For the second cone: \( \sqrt{y^2 + z^2} = \frac{3}{8}(5 - x) \).

4. **Sphere Centered at Origin**:
   - Assume the sphere is centered at the origin \((0, 0, 0)\) with radius \( r \).
   - The sphere must satisfy both cone equations: \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \leq \frac{3}{8}(5 - z) \) and \( \sqrt{y^2 + z^2} \leq \frac{3}{8}(5 - x) \).

5. **Finding the Minimal Distance**:
   - Use Lagrange multipliers to find the closest points on the cones to the origin.
   - For the first cone, the minimal distance is found by minimizing \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \) under the constraint \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \frac{3}{8}(5 - z) \).
   - Solving gives \( z = \frac{45}{73} \) and \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \frac{120}{73} \), leading to \( r = \frac{15}{\sqrt{73}} \).

6. **Verification**:
   - Check that the sphere of radius \( \frac{15}{\sqrt{73}} \) lies entirely within both cones by verifying the equations for all points on the sphere.
   - Transform the inequalities into quadratic forms and confirm they hold for all \( z \).

7. **Final Calculation**:
   - The radius squared is \( \left(\frac{15}{\sqrt{73}}\right)^2 = \frac{225}{73} \).
   - Thus, \( m = 225 \) and \( n = 73 \), leading to \( m + n = 298 \).

- Paragraph 3, Sentence 1: <keep>Let’s denote the intersection point of the axes as the origin (0,0,0).</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 2: <keep>The base of this cone is then at z = -3 (origin is 3 units from base, so moving down 3 units from the origin along the z-axis).</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 6: <keep>Similarly, the second cone, with its axis along the x-axis, will have its apex at (5,0,0), extending to x = -3, with radius 3 at x = -3.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 2: <keep>First, let's write the equations of the two cones.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 4: <keep>Similarly, the second cone (along the x-axis) will have apex at (5,0,0) and base at x = -3 with radius 3.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 6: <keep>Similarly, for the second cone, points (x,y,z) must satisfy sqrt(y2 + z2) <= 3*(5 - x)/8.</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 2: <keep>Since the origin is inside both cones, the sphere centered at the origin with radius r must satisfy both inequalities for all points on the sphere.</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 4: <keep>1. sqrt(x2 + y2) <= (3/8)(5 - z)</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 5: <keep>2. sqrt(y2 + z2) <= (3/8)(5 - x)</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 3: <keep>Using Lagrange multipliers, the gradient of f should be proportional to the gradient of g.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 9: <keep>dg/da = (a)/sqrt(a2 + b2)</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 10: <keep>dg/db = (b)/sqrt(a2 + b2)</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 12: <keep>Now, by method of Lagrange multipliers, we set ∇f = λ ∇g.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 2: <keep>Similarly, from the second: if b ≠ 0, then 2 = λ / sqrt(a2 + b2).</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 8: <keep>Then sqrt(a2 + b2) = (3/8)(5 - c )</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 12: <keep>So substitute sqrt(a2 + b2):</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 15: <keep>73c= 45</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 17: <keep>Then sqrt(a2 + b2 + c2 ) = sqrt( (9/64)(5 - c )2 + c2 )</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 1: <keep>Similarly, let's compute the minimal distance for the second cone.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 3: <keep>To find the minimal distance from the origin to this cone, we can perform similar steps.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 6: <keep>From the first equation: 2a = λ*(3 /8 ) => a = (λ *3 )/(16 )</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 10: <keep>So:</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 14: <keep>73λ=240</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 16: <keep>Therefore sqrt(b2 +c2 )=240/(73*2 )=120/73 ≈1.6438</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 2: <keep>Thus, the minimal distance from the origin to each cone is 15/sqrt(73), same for both cones, so approximately 1.758.</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 3: <keep>Therefore, the maximum possible radius r would be 15/sqrt(73).</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 6: <keep>Hmm, but wait, does this sphere actually fit entirely inside both cones?</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 1: <keep>But if we take a different point on the sphere, e.g. where the sphere intersects the x-axis.</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 5: <keep>So sqrt(y2 + z2 ) must be ≤1.215. However, at (15/sqrt(73 ),0,0 ), the y and z are 0, so ok.</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 1: <keep>But maybe it's better to consider points tangential to both cones.</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 4: <keep>Similarly, the closest point on the second cone would be (45/73,0,120/73 ) but with x and z swapped?</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 13: <keep>Therefore, if the sphere is centered at the origin with radius 15/sqrt(73 ), then it touches both cones at these two points.</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentence 1: <keep>We need to check this by examining different points on the sphere.</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentence 4: <keep>Check that sqrt(x2 + y2 ) <= (3/8)(5 - z )</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentence 8: <keep>Left: 14400 - 4672 z2</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentence 9: <keep>Right: 16425 -6570 z +657 z2</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentence 12: <keep>Compute:</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentence 16: <keep>Therefore the quadratic is (73 z -45 )2 >=0. Which is always non-negative, as expected.</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentence 17: <keep>Therefore, equality occurs when z=45/73, and inequality (the quadratic >=0) is always true.</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, the maximum radius is indeed r=15/sqrt(73 ), so r2=225/73.</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 3: <keep>But wait, the problem says "the sphere with radius r lies within both cones. The maximum possible value of r2 is m/n".</keep>
