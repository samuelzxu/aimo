Okay, let me work through the problem step by step. So, we need to label the vertices of a regular nonagon with digits 1 through 9 such that every three consecutive vertices sum to a multiple of 3. Also, rotations of arrangements are considered the same, so we need to account for rotational symmetry.

First, I'll consider the residues of each digit modulo 3. The digits 1-9 modulo 3 are:

- 1, 4, 7 ≡ 1 mod 3
- 2, 5, 8 ≡ 2 mod 3
- 3, 6, 9 ≡ 0 mod 3

Each residue class has exactly three numbers. The key requirement is that every three consecutive digits sum to 0 mod 3. If we denote the residues of the vertices as r0, r1, ..., r8, then for each i, ri + ri+1 + ri+2 ≡ 0 mod 3 (indices modulo 9).

By analyzing the recurrence relation derived from these equations, we find that the residues must repeat every three positions. This means the residues are periodic with period 3. Therefore, the residues at positions i, i+3, i+6 are the same. This divides the nonagon into three groups of three vertices each (0,3,6; 1,4,7; 2,5,8).

Each group must be assigned a distinct residue (0, 1, 2). The permutations of these residues among the three groups give 3! = 6 possibilities. For each permutation, the digits within each residue class can be permuted in 3! ways for each group, leading to (3!)^3 permutations.

Thus, the total number of valid arrangements without considering rotation is 3! * (3!)^3 = 6 * 6^3 = 1296.

Next, we account for rotational symmetry. Using Burnside's lemma, we calculate the number of distinct arrangements by averaging the number of fixed arrangements under each rotation. Since all labels are distinct, only the identity rotation fixes any arrangements, contributing 1296 fixed arrangements. All other rotations contribute 0. Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements is 1296 / 9 = 144.

So, the final answer is 144.
