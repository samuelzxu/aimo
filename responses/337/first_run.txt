Okay, I need to figure out which parts of the reasoning are essential for future steps. Let's start by breaking down the thought process.

The problem is solving an integral equation using Laplace transforms. The key steps are recognizing the convolution, applying the Laplace transform to both sides, simplifying the equation to solve for F(s), and then taking the inverse transform. Also, verifying the solution by substitution and differentiation is important.

Looking at the Laplace transform part, the transformation of the convolution to multiplication is crucial. The specific equations where F(s)/(s² + 1) = F(s) - 1/(s² + 1) and solving for F(s) are critical points.

The verification steps, both by substituting f(x) = x into the original equation and differentiating to get another integral equation, reinforce the solution. These steps should be highlighted because they ensure the solution's validity.

The final conclusion that f(x) = x is necessary to retain, as it's the answer. Also, mentioning that the Laplace inverse of 1/s² gives x is key.

I'll go through each paragraph and sentence to mark the essential parts. The explanation about Volterra equations might be less critical once the Laplace method is established, but the steps where equations are manipulated must be kept. The integration by parts during verification is also essential to show correctness.

Hmm, I need to ensure that all crucial equations and logical steps are marked. Also, the substitution and differentiation steps should be included. The final answer is definitely a kept part. Let me count to ensure at least 17 blocks.
