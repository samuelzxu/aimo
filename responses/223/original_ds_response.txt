Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked here. We have a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell operating at 70% efficiency. The cell reaction is given, and we need to find the change in temperature of a monoatomic ideal gas when the work from the fuel cell is used to compress it adiabatically (since the container is thermally insulated). 

Let me break this down. The fuel cell produces electrical work, which is then used to compress the gas. Because the process is adiabatic, there's no heat exchange, so all the work done on the gas will change its internal energy, and hence its temperature. For an ideal gas, the change in internal energy is related to the temperature change by ΔU = nCvΔT, where Cv is the molar heat capacity at constant volume. Since it's a monoatomic gas, Cv is (3/2)R.

So, first things first: I need to find the electrical work produced by the fuel cell when 1.0×10−3 mol of O2 is consumed, then account for the 70% efficiency, and then use that work to calculate ΔT.

Wait, the problem says "consumption of 1.0×10−3 mol of O2(g)". Let me check the cell reaction: H2(g) + 1⁄2 O2(g) → H2O(l). So the stoichiometry is 1 mole H2 and 1⁄2 mole O2 produce 1 mole H2O. But here, they're talking about the consumption of O2. So, for each mole of H2O produced, 1⁄2 mole of O2 is consumed. But how does this relate to the electrical work?

Electrical work from a fuel cell is calculated using the formula: W = nFE, where n is the number of moles of electrons transferred, F is Faraday's constant, and E is the cell potential. Then multiply by the efficiency if that's not 100%. 

But first, let's determine the cell potential. The standard reduction potentials are given: O2 + 4H+ + 4e− → 2H2O, E0 = 1.23 V. The other half-reaction is 2H+ + 2e− → H2, E0 = 0.00 V. So, the overall cell reaction should be the combination of oxidation and reduction. 

Wait, in the standard hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell, hydrogen is oxidized and oxygen is reduced. The anode (oxidation) is H2 → 2H+ + 2e− (reverse of the given second reaction, so oxidation). The cathode (reduction) is O2 + 4H+ + 4e− → 2H2O. To balance electrons, let's multiply the anode reaction by 2 so that 4 electrons are released, matching the 4 electrons consumed in the cathode reaction. So:

Anode: 2H2 → 4H+ + 4e− (oxidation, E0_anode = 0.00 V)
Cathode: O2 + 4H+ + 4e− → 2H2O (reduction, E0_cathode = 1.23 V)
Overall: 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O, which corresponds to the cell reaction given (if we write it as H2 + 1⁄2 O2 → H2O).

E0_cell = E0_cathode - E0_anode = 1.23 V - 0.00 V = 1.23 V.

So, the standard cell potential is 1.23 V.

Now, how much charge is transferred when O2 is consumed? For each mole of O2 consumed, how many electrons are involved?

From the cathode half-reaction: 1 mole O2 consumes 4 moles e−. Because O2 is reduced in the cathode reaction, each O2 molecule accepts 4 electrons. Therefore, per mole of O2, 4 moles of electrons are transferred.

The total charge Q is n*F, where n is moles of electrons. So, if we consume 1 mole of O2, Q would be 4*F. But in this case, we're consuming 1.0×10−3 mol of O2. Therefore, moles of electrons = 4 * 1.0×10−3 mol = 4.0×10−3 mol. Hence, Q = 4.0×10−3 mol * 96500 C/mol.

Then, the theoretical work (assuming 100% efficiency) would be W = Q * E = nFE. Wait, actually, the formula is ΔG = -nFE, which is the maximum work obtainable. So the maximum electrical work the cell can provide is W_max = nFE. But since efficiency is 70%, the actual work is 0.70 * W_max.

Wait, let me check the formula again. The work done by the cell is nFE multiplied by the efficiency. Because the efficiency is 70%, only 70% of the theoretical maximum work is actually used. So the usable work here is 0.7*n*F*E.

So, first calculate n: how many moles of electrons per mole of O2. From the half-reaction, each O2 requires 4 electrons. So, as I had before, for 1.0×10−3 mol O2, moles of electrons n = 4*1.0×10−3 = 4.0×10−3 mol. 

Then, E is 1.23 V. F is 96500 C/mol. So Q = n*F = 4.0×10−3 *96500, and then W_theoretical = Q*E = n*F*E. But since efficiency is 70%, the actual work is 0.7 * n * F * E.

Once I have the actual work, this work is used to compress the gas adiabatically. Since the process is adiabatic (Q=0), the first law says ΔU = W. For an ideal gas, ΔU = nCvΔT. So, solving for ΔT, we have ΔT = W / (nCv).

Here, the gas is 1.00 mol of monoatomic ideal gas, so Cv is (3/2)R. Therefore, ΔT = W / (1.00 * (3/2)R) = (2W)/(3R).

Putting all together: compute W = 0.7 * n * F * E, then compute ΔT = 2*W / (3*R).

Now let's plug in the numbers step by step.

First, n (moles of electrons) for 1.0×10^-3 mol O2:

n = 4 * 1.0×10^-3 = 4.0×10^-3 mol e^-

Then, compute W = 0.7 * n * F * E.

F is 96500 C/mol

E is 1.23 V

So W = 0.7 * 4.0×10^-3 mol * 96500 C/mol * 1.23 V

Note that volts are joules per coulomb (1 V = 1 J/C), so multiplying by volts gives joules.

Calculating:

First, 4.0×10^-3 * 96500 = 4.0×10^-3 * 9.65×10^4 = 4*9.65×10^1 = 38.6×10^1 = 386 C

Wait, wait:

4.0×10^-3 *96500 = 4*96500*10^-3 = (4*96500)/1000 = 386000/1000 = 386 C.

Then 386 C * 1.23 V = 386 *1.23 J = let me compute that.

386 * 1.2 = 463.2, 386 *0.03=11.58, so total is 463.2 +11.58 = 474.78 J. So about 474.78 J.

Then multiply by 0.7 for efficiency: 474.78 *0.7 ≈ 332.346 J. Rounding to three significant figures, 332 J.

Wait, but 474.78 *0.7: 474.78*0.7 equals:

400*0.7 = 280, 74.78*0.7≈52.35; total 280 +52.35=332.35 J. So approximately 332 J.

Therefore, the work done on the gas is 332 J. Since compression is work done ON the gas, the sign is positive for ΔU. So we have ΔU = 332 J.

Then, for the gas, which is 1.00 mol monotomic, Cv = (3/2)R. R is 8.314 J/mol·K. So:

Cv = (3/2)*8.314 ≈12.471 J/mol·K.

Therefore, ΔT = ΔU / (n_gas *Cv) = 332 J / (1.00 mol *12.471 J/mol·K) ≈ 332 /12.471 ≈26.63 K.

Approximately 26.6 K increase. Let me verify the calculations.

Wait: 3/2*8.314=12.471, that's correct. Then, 332/12.471. Let's compute:

12.471 *26 = 12.471*20=249.42, 12.471*6=74.826, total 249.42+74.826≈324.246.

12.471*26.6 : 324.246 +12.471*0.6=324.246+7.483≈331.729. So, indeed, 12.471*26.6 ≈331.73, which is just a bit higher than 332. So likely 26.6 K. But perhaps the more precise calculation?

Wait, let's do division properly:

ΔT = 332 /12.471 ≈?

Well, 12.471 goes into 332 how many times?

12.471*26=324.246

332-324.246≈7.754

7.754 /12.471≈0.622. So total is approximately26.622, so about26.6 K. If precise to two decimal places,26.62 K. But the question says "change in temperature (in K)", so probably wants a whole number or one decimal place. But maybe we did some approximation before.

Wait, maybe when doing intermediate steps, the work was a bit different. Let me check.

Original calculation steps again:

W = 0.7 * n *F * E. So n =4.0e-3, F=96500, E=1.23.

Compute:

4.0e-3 *96500=4*96.5=386. So 386 is correct.

Then 386*1.23=386*(1 +0.2 +0.03)=386*1 =386, 386*0.2=77.2, 386*0.03=11.58. Total = 386+77.2+11.58=474.78 J. Correct.

Multiplying by 0.7 gives 474.78*0.7: let's calculate:

474.78 *0.7

Well, 400*0.7=280

74.78*0.7=52.346

Total 280+52.346=332.346 J. As before. So W=332.346 J.

Now, ΔT = W / (n_gas * Cv). n_gas=1.00 mole, Cv=12.471 J/mol·K.

So ΔT =332.346 /12.471. Compute this.

Divide 332.346 by12.471.

12.471*26=324.246

332.346 -324.246=8.1

8.1 /12.471≈0.649

So ΔT≈26.649 K. Approximately26.65 K, so around26.7 K. But depending on rounding in intermediate steps.

But maybe we should check precise value of 332.346 /12.471. Let me compute that.

Alternatively:

332.346 ÷12.471 ≈ ?

Let me write as 332.346 /12.471 ≈

Calculating:

12.471 * 26 = 324.246

332.346 -324.246 =8.1

Now, bring a decimal: 8.1 becomes 81.0 since we can 8.1 /12.471 is like 0.649.

Alternatively, let me use cross multiplication:

12.471 * x =332.346

x =332.346 /12.471 ≈ Using calculator:

Divide numerator and denominator by 12.471:

12.471 × 26 = 324.246

332.346 -324.246=8.1

So 8.1 /12.471 ≈0.6496

Therefore, x≈26.6496, so approx26.65 K. Rounding to two decimal places,26.65 K. If we take three significant figures since most values given are 3 or 4 sig figs. 

But let's verify if all our initial values have enough precision. The problem states:

- 70% efficient: two sig figs.

- Consumption of1.0×10−3 mol of O2(g): two sig figs.

- 1.00 mol of gas: three sig figs.

The constants are F=96500 (three sig figs or exact?), R=8.314 (four sig figs).

So, perhaps we can have three sig figs in the answer. Let me check again.

n electrons:4.0×10^-3 (two sig figs due to 1.0×10^-3?) Hmm, 1.0×10−3 mol of O2 is given as 1.0 (two sig figs), then n=4.0×10^-3 (two sig figs).

E=1.23 V (three sig figs). F=96500 (three sig figs). So when multiplying:

0.7 (one sig fig? Wait, 70% efficiency is sometimes considered two sig figs. If the question says 70% it's ambiguous, but here maybe 70.%, so two sig figs. In that case, then:

Work calculation would have two sig figs from the 0.70, but generally, when dealing with precise calculations, the efficiency as 0.70 (two decimal places, two sig figs). So likely, the least number of sig figs comes from the 1.0×10^-3 (two) and the 0.70 (two). But perhaps others have higher. But constants given in R=8.314 is four.

Anyway, following through, the answer will probably be around26.6 or26.7 K. Let's round to three sig figs: 26.6 K. But perhaps the exact value is ~26.7 K. Wait, another thought.

Wait, perhaps my calculation of moles of electrons is wrong. Wait, the problem states the consumption of1.0×10^-3 mol of O2(g). The cell reaction is H2 + 1⁄2 O2 → H2O. So for each mole of H2O produced, 1⁄2 mole of O2 is consumed. So for every mole of O2 consumed, 2 moles of H2O are produced. Let's confirm:

Wait, stoichiometry of H2 +1⁄2 O2 → H2O.

Multiplying by 2: 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. So per 1 mole O2 consumed, 2 moles H2O are produced, which involves 4 moles of electrons (from the half-reactions). So the number of moles of electrons per mole O2 is indeed 4. Hence, the n we calculated before is correct: n=4*1.0×10^{-3}=0.004 moles e^-.

So calculation is correct.

Another consideration: the specific formula for work. Since electrical work is W = Q * V. However, in the context of Gibbs free energy, ΔG° = -nFE. Therefore, the maximum work attainable is -ΔG° =nFE. Since we're considering work done by the cell on the surroundings (the gas), that should be positive. But also we have efficiency, so actual work delivered is 0.7*nFE. So our calculation approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps in the process of compressing the gas, the work done by the fuel cell is positive work done on the gas, so sign conventions are okay.

Moreover, for an adiabatic process on an ideal gas, ΔU = W, where W is work done ON the gas (compression). Since the problem states that the work derived from the cell is used to compress the gas, so that work is positive and equal to ΔU.

Thus, integrating the entire procedure seems correct.

So, finally, the temperature change is approximately26.6 or26.7 K. Let me check decimal points.

Wait more precisely:

332.346 J / (1.00 mol *12.471 J/mol·K) = 332.346 /12.471 ≈?

Let me perform exact division:

332.346 ÷12.471 ≈

12.471 ×26 = 324.246

Difference: 332.346 -324.246 =8.1

8.1 /12.471=0.649...

So total:26.649≈26.65 K. Rounded to two decimal places,26.65 K. But given input parameters, maybe should round to two significant figures since the oxygen consumed is given as1.0×10−3 (two sig figs), the efficiency70% (two sig figs), and E was three. The gas amount is1.00 (three sig figs). But uncertainties compound. 

Since the leading uncertainty is from 70% and1.0×10−3, both two sig figs. So maybe the answer should be two sig figs:27 K. But 26.65 is approximately27 if we need two sig figs, but the problem says "change in the temperature (in K)" and didn't specify, so maybe three sig figs are acceptable. However, in the original data, the consumption of1.0×10−3 is two sig figs, so that is a key initial value. So likely, it's expected two sig figs. But is there a strict protocol here? Let me check calculations once more.

Wait, my Cv was computed as (3/2)R, which is exactly (3/2)*8.314=12.471. Then, W=332.346 J, divided by1.00*12.471= 332.346/12.471≈26.65. So roughly26.6 K.

But perhaps the user expects the answer expressed with proper considerations, which could be two or three digits.


Alternatively, maybe I messed up on stoichiometry.

Wait, let's reevaluate the number of moles of electrons again. The overall cell reaction is H2 + 1⁄2 O2 → H2O. The half-reactions are:

Oxidation (anode): H2 → 2H+ + 2e− (each H2 molecule releases 2 electrons)
Reduction (cathode): O2 + 4H+ +4e− → 2H2O (each O2 molecule gains 4 electrons)

To combine them, multiply the oxidation by 2 to get 2H2 →4H+ + 4e−, and the reduction is O2 +4H+ +4e− →2H2O. Adding both, 2H2 + O2→2H2O. Then, divide by 2 to get H2 +1⁄2 O2 →H2O, same as given. Thus, per mole of O2 consumed,4 moles of electrons are transferred, which is correct. Therefore, per 1.0×10^-3 mol O2, n electrons is4.0×10^-3, as calculated.

Therefore, the initial calculations seem correct.

Given possible rounding, if the exact value is26.65 K, but presented to three sig figs is26.6 K. If to two sig figs,27 K.

Looking back at problem statement:

They give Standard reduction potentials to two decimal places (1.23 V and0.00 V), Faraday constant as96500 C/mol−1 (three sig figs?), R as8.314 J/mol·K (four sig figs). Amounts are given as1.0×10−3 (two sig figs), gas as1.00 (three sig figs), efficiency as70% (two sig figs). Temperature is298 K (three sig figs). Probably, the answer should have two sig figs due to efficiency and moles O2 given with two sig figs.

But let's check the steps:

If in W calculation it is possible:

0.7*(4.0×10−3 mol e−)*96500 C/mol e− *1.23 V =0.7*4.0×10−3*96500*1.23

Compute step-by-step.

But with 0.7*4.0×10−3=2.8×10−3

Then, 2.8×10−3 *96500 =2.8*96.5=270.2 (since 96500=96.5 ×103, so 2.8×10−3 *96.5×103=2.8*96.5×10^0=270.2)

Then, 270.2 *1.23=270.2*1=270.2, 270.2*0.2=54.04, 270.2*0.03=8.106; sum them=270.2+54.04=324.24 +8.106=332.346.

Same result as before. So the result is332.346 J. ThenΔT=332.346 /(1.00×12.471)=26.65 K.

So 26.65 K. Depending on significant figures, is332.346 J three sig figs? The leading digits here, the0.7 and4.0×10−3, which are two sig figs and two sig figs. So 0.7 (1 sig fig?) Wait,70% is two sig figs. So efficiency is0.70 (two demical places), if exactly70% it is two significant figures.

Given that 70% is two sig figs, the fuel cell uses 1.0×10−3 mol, two sig figs, voltage three sig figs. R is four sig figs, F is three. So in that case, the actual work would be 0.70 *4.0×10−3 *96500 *1.23 ≈ which, when calculating:

0.70 (two sig figs) *4.0×1e-3 (two) * 96500 (three) *1.23 (three). The number of sig figs in the result is determined by the least number, which is two, from 0.70 and4.0e-3. So the actual work has two sig figs: approximately330 J (since332.346 approx330). Then, when computingΔT, 330 /12.471 ≈26.5, which again would be approximately27 K with two sig figs. However, given sometimes the rules for sig figs when multiplying/dividing steps, but I think using the standard rules: intermediate steps keep more digits and only round the final answer. Given that the gas is1.00 mol (three sig figs), so the denominator is12.471 (four sig figs).

The overall multiplication gives:

0.70 *4.0e-3 *96500 *1.23 = two* two* three* three= the value with two sig figs: but not exactly. Because when you have multiple numbers with different sig figs, the least is two sig figs, but maybe here it's a bit flexible. But perhaps answer expects26.6 K. As the calculated exact value is ~26.65, likely, the answer is to the nearest whole number. If checking the options, maybe possible options are 27 K. Wait, but when calculating precisely,26.65~26.6 to three sig figs, but 27 to two.

Wait, let me see: if the question expects the answer in whole number, then it's27 K. However, since all steps and given values allow for three decimal precision, but given that the consumption is two, efficiency is two, perhaps it's expected to present two sig figs. But in common practices, the voltage is1.23 V (three sig figs), the O2 is2 sig figs, gas moles is three sig figs. So maybe it's a strict interpretation for two sig figs.

But since some of the steps like n electrons would be strictly 4.0e-3 (two sig figs), then:

Work would be0.7 (two sig) *4.0e-3 (two)*96500 (three)*1.23 (three), so the numbers with two sig figs are0.7 and4.0e-3, but multiply with others having more. So result in this case would have two sig figs. Hence, the Work is3.3×102 J (two sig figs). Then,ΔT= 3.3×102 / (1.00×12.47)≈ (330)/12.47≈26.5, which isapprox27 K when rounded to two sig figs.

But the problem says "change in the temperature (in K)" and it's an AP/General Chemistry problem? In such problems, sometimes they round according to the given sig figs rather than strict rules. Alternatively, check an example:

Suppose all work and moles and calculations give 26.6... Should we answer26.6 K or27 K. Since the problem says "put your final answer within boxed{}" and probably expects two dec places? Wait, no. The final answer format is just in K, maybe rounded as integer.

But given that in the calculations, precise value is approx26.6, so27 K when two sig figs or26.6 K when one decimal. But let me check the problem statement again: "change in the temperature (in K)" without specifying decimal places, R is given as8.314 which has four.

Well, given that 12.471 is ΔU/Cv and 332.346 J, which come from precise calculations, but some data is limiting. In that case, likely, the answer should have two significant figures. Let me check what the answer may be. Let's recalculate with two sig figs:

If Work is two sig figs: 330 J.

ΔT = 330 /12.471≈26.5≈27 K.

So the answer would be approximately27 K. But in the exact division, it is approximately26.6. But conflicting.

Wait another thought: maybe somewhere the number of moles of electrons isdifferent. Maybe they do per H2O molecule: since per H2O, the electron transfer is?

Wait, generating one H2O molecule involves how many electrons? From the oxidation of H2 and reduction of O2.

For each H2 molecule, oxidation releases 2e−, and in the overall reaction1 H2 gives1 H2O (from1 H2 +1⁄2 O2) , so per mole of H2O, 2 moles e−. But considering the reduction side, each O2 molecule accepts4 e− for 2 H2O (since O2 +4H+ +4e−→ 2H2O). So per mole of H2O,2 e−. But per mole of O2 consumed, since each O2 produces2 moles H2O, which transfers4 e− per O2 molecule, as before. Hence, for the consumption of1.0×10−3 mol O2, the moles of electrons are4×1.0e-3.

Therefore, correct.

So, given all sources of potential errors checked, I think the calculation is correct. Then the problem maybe expects the answer to two decimal places, which would be26.65≈26.7 K. However, the R is given as8.314, which is exact(no, R is a constant with value exactly defined? Probably not; users commonly take R=8.314 J/mol·K.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is simply \boxed{26.6} K. But in standard testing, they often account for significant figures. But here it seems that most of the given data allows for two sig figs at least. If I think the answer is meant to be26.6 K (three sig figs), the user may need to round based on if they followed strict sig figs.

Alternatively, if compute exact as26.65 K and round to two sig figs, then answer is27 K. But in this solution, if presented with actual calculation steps,26.65 which could round to26.6 or27. But the answer can't be both. Wait, let me verify once more. The numbers:

Work done is 332.346 J, calculated using several multiplications. Let's see: if we follow more precisely:

Starting with gas moles =1.00 mol (three sig figs).

Calculated ΔT=332.346 J / (1.00 mol *12.471 J/(mol·K))≈26.649 K, as shown above. So result is26.649 K≈26.6 K.

Given,1.0×10^-3 mol O2 is two sig figs,n=4*0.001=0.004 (also two sig figs, written as4.0×10^-3?), the efficiency is70% which is two sig figs, others: F=96500 (three), E=1.23 (three). The product of these: two sig figs * three sig figs = two? But multiplications actually each step:

Efficiency % (70, two sig), then multiply O2 moles (two), Faraday's (three), E (three). All multiplied: minimum of two so answer is two sig figs. So results in3.3×102 J, / 12.471 (four sig). The division of two sig figs (since W is two) by four sig = two sig. So the ΔT is answer in two sig.

If delta T is3.3×102 J /12.471 J/K =approx330 /12.471≈26.5. Round to two sig figs: 27 K. Hence, after enforcing significant figures rules strictly, answer is27 K.

But is70% two sig figs? Yes, because it's given as70%, implying two. Same with1.0e-3 as two. Thus, the conclusion would be the temp change is27 K.

However, I’m conflicted because my precise calculation gives26.6. But considering significant figure rules, it might need to be27.

But in testing scenarios, some answer choices may have values like27 and26.6 as options, so determining correctly. But given the problem instruction does not specify, but instructs to put the answer in a box, maybe do an exact fraction.

Wait, 332.346 /12.471:

It's 332.346 ÷12.471 ≈ 26.65.

In precise terms, ΔT≈26.7 K if rounded to three significant figures, since26.65 rounds to26.6 if rounding to three sig figs. Wait, how's that?

Wait, for three sig figs:26.65 is third sig fig as6. We look at the next digit, which is5. So, round up the third significant figure. So26.65 would be26.7 (three sig figs). Thus,26.7 K.

Alternatively, if two sig figs, it would be27.

But the answer likely expects three significant figures due to the involved multiplication steps with up to three significant figures. Let's check again.

Wait, with n=4.0×10−3 (two sig figs), F=96500 (three), E=1.23 (three), efficiency=0.70 (two). W=0.70 *4.0×10−3 *96500 *1.23.

The significant figures here:

- The number with the fewest sig figs is4.0×10−3 (two) and0.70 (two). So the product will have two sig figs. Therefore, W=0.70 *4.0×10^-3=2.8×10^-3 (two sig figs). Then multiply by F:

2.8×10^-3 *96500=270.2 (still two sig figs:2.7×102). Then multiplied by1.23≈270.2*1.23=332.3, but since W should have two sig figs, this is3.3×102 J. Then nCv=1.00*(3/2)*8.314=12.471 (this is3/2*8.314=12.471, Cv has four sig figs). But since W is3.3×102 J (two sig), ΔT=330/12.471≈26.5. So with two sig figs, this rounds to27 K.

Therefore, under two sig figs rules,ΔT≈27 K.

But perhaps the problem assumes3 sig figs since cell potential is1.23 and so. But there is inconsistency also.

The problem statement asks "change in the temperature...", which answer type is usually K with possible decimal. Given the exact value is approximately26.65 K, depending on their system’s rounding standard, but without more information, it's prudent to write26.6 K or26.7 K.

But this is a h2gaussian's problem - ultimately, perhaps give exactly as the calculation gave26.65 K, rounds to either.

But given possible choices, the answer might be27 K.

Alternatively, we can check step-by-step:

n = 4.0×10^-3 mol(2 sf)
Efficiency =70% ⇒ 0.70 (2 sf)
nFE:4.0e-3 mol ×96500 C/mol=386 C (3 sf)
386 C ×1.23 V =474.78 J(3 sf)
Work actual=0.70×474.78 J=332.346 J (2 sf)
Ahh, actually, when we multiply by0.70 (which is two sf), we constrain the result to two sf. Therefore, 474.78 J ≈475 J (three sf) times0.70 is332.5 J, which under two sf gives330 J. Therefore W=330 J (two sf). Then, nCv=1.00×12.471 J/K=12.471 J/K (four sf). SoTΔk=330 J /12.471 J/K≈26.5 K. So after rounding,27 K.

Thus, finally, the change in temperature is approximately27 K when strictly following significant figures.

However, the precise calculation yields26.65 K, which rounds to26.7 K. Alternatively, the precise fractional answer:

In any case, given the user hasn't specified how to handle sig figs, but likely to expect proper sig figs (two) hence27 K. However, looking around for similar problems often, sometimes they leave .0 decimal even if sig figs imply rounding. But in this case, possibly accept rounded answer.

Given that, after going through the entire process, I would submit \boxed{27} K.

Wait, but prior calculation came to approximately26.6. But according to sig figs rules, if strictly adhering, the work calculated is3.3×102 J (two sf), then so on. Then,ΔT =3.3×102 / 12.471≈26.46≈26. But no. Wait3.3×102 is330, not3.3×102.

ΔT=330 ÷12.471≈26.46 which rounds to26 (two sig figs?)

But wait,330 has two sig figs, so26.46→26(two) or as it were.

But no—the denominator is12.471, four sig figs.

Wait now, problem arises because the denominator has more sig figs. In division, the result has the same number of sig figs as the term with the least. So given W=330 J (two sf)/12.471(four).

Therefore, the least sf is two, so ΔT=26 K. But that seems off.


Indeed, examples online will show that when you have division, likex=a/b, wherea two sf, b four sf, result should be two sf.

But. Let's compute330 /12.471. Actually, on calculator:

330 divided by12.471≈26.463, which is approximately26.5 when rounded to two significant figures, as the first two digits are26. which is two sig figs. But when the first two digits in a number with more digits.

Wait, if you are to round to two significant figures. The exact value is≈26.463.

Identifying the first two significant figures:2 and6. The next digit is4, which is less than5; therefore,round down. So26.463 becomes26 when rounded to two sig figs. But 26is an integer. However, often, in cases where the first digit would round up (if next digit 5 or higher), but here next digit is4, which is less than5.

Wait, however, 26.463 with two sig figs: the second sig fig after2 is6, next digit is4, so we keep6 and truncate. Hence26. HenceΔT≈26 K.

But that's conflicting with other versions. Alternatively, how does significant figure rules work for decimal numbers?

Wait, the key idea in significant figures: whether there's a decimal present. Numbers without decimal, trailing zeros may not be significant, but for example,2600 has two sig figs. But 26.463 rounded to two sig figs would be26. Yes, 26. Here26.463, two sig figs as2 and6.

But still, 26.463 without a decimal is ambiguous. Wait no, numbers: when written to two sig figs.

But there's a decimal in the division here. Let me think:

26.463 K=26.5 K when rounded to three sig figs. And26 when to two.

But in context of original problem sig figs: gas amount1.00 mol(three), n O2=1.0×10−3(two), efficiency70%(two), E=1.23(three), others more. So. Since most quantities besides O2 and efficiency have more sig figs, if the calculation had not required that it is strictly bound to two. The problem is efficiency and O2 moles. Because when efficiency and O2 are key factors to the work.

However, if an error is caused here by misunderstanding which values take how many significant figures, perhaps in such context, this could cause me to consider using three sig figs.

But in sum, after stepping back, the answer is approximately26.6 K, but strict adherence to sig figs (without knowing designer's policy) leans toward26 K or27 K, which is unclear. But using the initial figures,0.70 (two),1.0×10−3 (two).

If calculated without sig fig constraints,26.65 K.

But, recalling the user provided E as1.23 V, which is three sig figs, if we take everything with all given significant figures:

0.70 *4.0e-3 *96500 *1.23=0.70 (two) ×0.004 (one? 4.0e-3 is two)) ?

No, no:1.0×10^-3 is two (because decimal:1.0 is two sig figs). Similarly, F=96500 is three.

Oxygen mol:1.0×10^-3 is two sf. Efficiency:70%→0.70, two sf. Then work would be two sf.

ΔT=W/(nCv)=330 J/(1.00*12.471 J/K)=about26.463 K. When given sig figs=two, it's26 K; but that contradicts the exact value. 

Given this confusion, and looking back at original problem:

They specifically said 1.0 ×10−3 (two),70% (two), E 1.23 (three), F=96500 (probably exact—since it's a defined value). So if F is exact (no error), then the factors governing SF are oxygen moles (two), efficiency(two), and E (three). Hence, least SF is two. Therefore, W=0.70*4.0e-3*96500*1.23 which should be taken as two SF. So W=3.3e2 J (330 J。 (330) Two SF.

Then ΔT=330 / (1.00*(3/2)*8.314) ≈330 /12.471≈26.46. Rounded to Two SF:26 K。

No, but 26.46 isn't approximately26 K (two SF), but it's26. Or according to two SF rules.

First, 330 J /12.471 J/K, let's think.

Express the numbers in scientific notation:

330 =3.3×102
12.471≈1.2471×101
Divide:3.3×102 /1.2471×101=(3.3/1.2471) ×10^(2-1)=~2.647×101≈26.47≈26.5.

Wait, with two SF? 3.3/1.2471=2.647, which when expressed as two SF becomes2.6,so 2.6×101=26。

Ah, in division, using SF rules:3.3(two SF)/1.2471(five SF)==. The result has two SF.

Thus, step-by-step:

3.3 /1.2471= approx2.647 but rounding to two SF is2.6,then2.6×101=26。

Thus,ΔT=26 K.

But this contradicts the calculated26.47.

Thus, following strictest SF rules with two sig figs, ΔT=26 K. But this is just perplexing.

Alternately, in practice, when the problem comes from educational material and gives values like1.0e-3 (two sig figs)、70% (two), but the cell potential three, F3, R= four, then the answer should be given as27 K.

However, perhaps this is more trouble than it's worth. Given that my precise calculation gives≈26.6 K. In most textbooks and databases, such as those in Chemistry, if the process is adiabatic and q=0, then ΔU=W. The calculation gives26.6 K. Hence, I think it's more accurate to say that the temperature change is approximately27 K. A final Answer rounded to two sig figs is27 K.

Therefore, after thorough consideration, I'll put the answer as\boxed{27}\ K.


**Final Answer**
\boxed{27}
