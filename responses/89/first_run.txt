Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. We know that 2/5 of the children are girls, which means 3/5 must be boys. There are 100 boys in the class. To find the number of girls, we first need to determine the total number of children. 

Let's denote the total number of children as T. Since 3/5 of T equals 100, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{3}{5}T = 100
\]
Solving for T:
\[
T = 100 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{500}{3} \approx 166.67
\]
Now, calculating the number of girls using 2/5 of T:
\[
\text{Girls} = \frac{2}{5} \times \frac{500}{3} = \frac{1000}{3} \approx 66.67
\]
Even though the result is a fractional number, which isn't practical in real life, mathematically, the number of girls is 200/3. The problem might expect this fractional answer despite the real-world inconsistency.

- Paragraph 1, Sentence 3: <keep>If 2/5 of the total are girls, then the number of girls is (2/5)*T. So boys would be T - (2/5)*T, right?</keep>
- Paragraph 1, Sentence 4: <keep>Simplifying that, boys = (1 - 2/5)*T = (3/5)*T.</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 2: <keep>But we are told that the number of boys is 100. So, (3/5)*T = 100. Then we can solve for T.</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 3: <keep>T = 100*(5/3)= ?</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 3: <keep>Number of boys = 3/5 * T = 100.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 4: <keep>Therefore, T = (100 *5)/3 = 500/3. Hmm, which is 166.666...</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 5: <keep>But since you can't have a fraction of a child, is that possible?</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 1: <keep>Let me express it in equations.</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 3: <keep>Given that G = (2/5) T. So,</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 4: <keep>G = (2/5)(G + 100)</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 5: <keep>Multiply both sides by 5:</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 6: <keep>5G = 2(G + 100)</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 7: <keep>5G = 2G + 200</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 8: <keep>Subtract 2G:</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 9: <keep>3G = 200</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 10: <keep>G = 200 / 3 ≈ 66.666....</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 11: <keep>Hmm, again, fractional.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, either the problem is designed to have fractional children, which doesn't exist, leading to an answer of 66.666..., which must be reported as 66 or 67.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 2: <keep>If the problem allows fractional parts for students, then 200/3 is acceptable.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 4: <keep>But assuming child can be fractional then proceed.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 5: <keep>Hence, boxed.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 1: <keep>Conclusion is problem as presented is unsolvable in integers.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 2: <keep>Thus, answering.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 1: <keep>\boxed{\dfrac{200}{3}}</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 1: <keep>Wait, 100 multiplied by 5 is 500, divided by 3 is approximately 166.666... But wait, the total number of children has to be a whole number, right?</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 2: <keep>If 2/5 are girls, then 3/5 are boys.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 1: <keep>If 2/5 of the children, 40% girls, 60% boys, which is 100 boys.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 2: <keep>Total children T = 100 / 0.6 ≈ 166.666...</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 3: <keep>Girls = 0.4 * 166.666 ≈ 66.666...</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 2: <keep>Let G = number of girls, B = number of boys = 100. T = total = G + B</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 3: <keep>Therefore, answering \boxed{\dfrac{200}{3}}.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 3: <keep>So if we go by that, answer is 200/3, which is 66 and two-thirds.</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 4: <keep>But since it says 'exactly,' probably not.</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 5: <keep>Wait, is there another interpretation?</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 1: <keep>Girls are 2/5 of the total, boys are 3/5 of the total.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 6: <keep>Therefore, T must be (5/3)*100 = 500/3 ≈166.666...</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 4: <keep>But no. If 2/5 of the children are girls. Let that parse.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 5: <keep>"2/5 of the children (girls)" rather than "2/5th of the class are girls."</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 2: <keep>Substituting B = 100:</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 4: <keep>Written boxed as \boxed{\dfrac{200}{3}}.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 5: <keep>But, in real interpretation, which requires girls to be integers, there is inconsistency.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 4: <keep>But in standard problems, no.</keep>
