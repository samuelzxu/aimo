Okay, let's try to figure out which tokens to keep. The user wants to know the essential parts of the reasoning that are needed for future steps, especially for part (2) of the problem. 

First, looking at part (1), the important parts are probably the solutions for x and y, which lead to the intersection points. These points are used in part (2) to set up the area calculation. So the steps where they solve for x and y, and verify the points, are crucial.

In part (2), the key steps involve understanding how the hyperbola and ellipse interact, determining the regions to integrate, and setting up the integral. The integral bounds are based on the intersection points from part (1). The actual integration steps, like substitution and solving, are essential here.

Also, the final answers for both parts must be retained because they're the results. The calculation of the integral leading to the area expression is critical, including the substitution steps and the final expression involving pi and ln(3).

Things like the initial setup, derivations of equations, and verification steps (checking the points lie on both curves) might be important because they validate the intersection points which are used in the area calculation.

The parts where they discuss the hyperbola's position relative to the ellipse in different quadrants and intervals of x also matter because they determine the integration limits and the functions to integrate.

I need to go through each paragraph and pick the sentences that carry these essential elements. For example, when they solve the quadratic equation for z=x², that's a key step. The points found, the integral setup, and the integration results with substitution steps are all necessary.
