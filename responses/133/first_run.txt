Okay, let's go through this step by step. The user wants me to identify which parts of the thinking trajectory are essential for future reasoning steps. The final answer involves an equation that includes the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and probability density function (PDF) of the sum S1 + S2.

First, the initial problem setup: the user mentions selling a bundle with items 1 and 2 at price p12, cost t(c1 + c2). The purchase condition is S1 + S2 ≥ p12, and profit is p12 - t(c1 + c2). The key variables here are p12, t, c1, c2, S1, S2. These are all critical to retain because they're part of the formula in the final answer.

Next, the thought process dives into expected profit calculation. The expected profit is Pr(S1 + S2 ≥ p12) * (p12 - t(c1 + c2)). This formula is central to the solution, so any sentences explaining this must be kept.

Then, the differentiation step where they take the derivative of expected profit with respect to p12. The derivative involves the survival function (1 - F(p12)) and the PDF f(p12). The resulting equation after setting the derivative to zero is p12 = t(c1 + c2) + (1 - F(p12))/f(p12). This equation is the core of the final answer, so every part leading to this conclusion needs to be retained.

The discussions about the survival function and hazard rate are important because they explain why the formula is structured that way. Mentions of the inverse hazard rate and the necessity of knowing the distribution of S1 + S2 are also crucial because they clarify the conditions under which the formula applies.

The conclusion reiterates the formula using the CDF and PDF, which directly ties into the final boxed answer. Any sentences summarizing this result should be kept.

I need to make sure all essential components are marked: the variables involved, the expected profit equation, the derivative steps, the resulting optimal price equation, and the explanation of F and f functions. These parts are necessary for understanding how the final formula is derived and what each term represents.

I also need to check for redundancy. Some parts repeat the same concepts, like the expected profit formula and the derivative process. I should select the most concise yet complete explanations to avoid unnecessary tokens but ensure clarity. 

Lastly, the final answer's explanation about F and f being the CDF and PDF of S1 + S2 is vital for interpreting the formula, so that must be included.
