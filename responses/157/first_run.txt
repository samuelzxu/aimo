Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. We need to find the values of λ between 0 and 4 for which there's a point x in [0,1] such that f(x) ≠ x but f(f(x)) = x. This means we're looking for points that are part of a 2-cycle, not fixed points.

First, the function given is f(x) = λx(1 - x). Let's start by writing out f(f(x)):

f(f(x)) = λ * f(x) * (1 - f(x)) = λ²x(1 - x)[1 - λx(1 - x)].

We set f(f(x)) = x, which leads to the equation:

λ²x(1 - x)[1 - λx(1 - x)] = x.

Subtracting x from both sides and factoring out x gives:

x [λ²(1 - x)(1 - λx + λx²) - 1] = 0.

This equation is satisfied when x=0 (a fixed point) or when the expression in the brackets equals zero. We need to focus on the bracket term since x=0 is a fixed point we want to exclude.

Next, we find the fixed points by solving f(x) = x:

λx(1 - x) = x → x(λ(1 - x) - 1) = 0.

This gives fixed points at x=0 and x=1 - 1/λ (for λ ≥ 1). We need solutions to the original equation that are not these fixed points.

Expanding the bracket term from the f(f(x))=x equation leads to a cubic equation in x. By factoring out the known fixed points, we're left with a quadratic equation. Solving this quadratic using the discriminant reveals real solutions exist only when λ ≥ 3. However, at λ=3, the quadratic has a double root coinciding with the fixed point x=2/3, so no valid 2-cycle exists there.

Testing values between 3 and 4 (e.g., λ=4) confirms that valid 2-cycles exist where f(x) ≠ x but f(f(x)) = x. Therefore, the interval where these 2-cycles exist is (3, 4].
