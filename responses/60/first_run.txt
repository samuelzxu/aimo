Okay, let me start by understanding the problem. A stationary source emits sound at 492 Hz, and a car is approaching it at 2 m/s. The sound reflects off the car and comes back. We need to find the beat frequency when the original and reflected sounds are superimposed.

First, I recall the Doppler effect formulas. When the observer is moving towards a stationary source, the observed frequency increases. Then, when the car reflects the sound, it acts as a moving source towards the original source, causing another frequency shift. The beat frequency is the difference between the original and the twice-shifted frequency.

Let me break it down step by step. The car receives a higher frequency because it's moving towards the source. That's the first Doppler shift. Then, when the car reflects the sound back, it's now a moving source, so the frequency detected back at the original source is even higher—this is the second Doppler shift.

Calculating the first shift: f' = f0*(v + v_car)/v. Plugging in the numbers, (330 + 2)/330. Then, the second shift: f'' = f'*v/(v - v_car). Substituting f' here gives f'' = f0*(v + v_car)/(v - v_car).

Simplifying the ratio (332/328) reduces to 83/82. Since 492 divided by 82 is exactly 6, multiplying by 83 gives 498 Hz. The beat frequency is 498 - 492 = 6 Hz.

Wait, I need to make sure the formulas are correct. Double-checking: yes, the observer moving towards the source uses (v + v_o)/v, and the source moving towards the observer uses v/(v - v_s). Combining them gives (v + v_o)/(v - v_s) when both are approaching. Here, the car acts as both observer and source, so the same velocity applies, leading to the simplified factor. Then the arithmetic works out neatly because 492 is a multiple of 82, resulting in an exact integer answer. This makes sense and confirms that 6 Hz is correct.
