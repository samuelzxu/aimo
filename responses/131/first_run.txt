Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to find the floor of the sum S = a + b + c + d given the equations a² + b² = c² + d² = 2008 and ac = bd = 1000. 

First, I need to express c and d in terms of a and b. From ac = 1000 and bd = 1000, we get c = 1000/a and d = 1000/b. Substituting these into the equation c² + d² = 2008 gives (1000/a)² + (1000/b)² = 2008. Simplifying this leads to 1000²(1/a² + 1/b²) = 2008. 

Since a² + b² = 2008, we substitute that in and find that ab must be 1000. Using the identities for (a + b)² and (a - b)², we determine that a + b = √4008. Similarly, c + d also equals √4008. Therefore, the total sum S is 2√4008.

Next, approximating √4008, we find it's between 63 and 64. Refining the estimate through linear approximation and Newton-Raphson method gives √4008 ≈ 63.3088. Thus, 2√4008 ≈ 126.6175, and the floor of this value is 126.

- Paragraph 1, Sentence 4: <keep>They satisfy two equations: a2 + b2 = c2 + d2 = 2008, and also ac = bd = 1000.</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 3: <keep>From equation 3: c = 1000/a, since ac = 1000, so c = 1000/a.</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 4: <keep>Similarly, from equation 4: d = 1000/b.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 1: <keep>So substituting c and d expressions into equation 2:</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 4: <keep>(1000)^2 ( (a2 + b2)/(a2 b2) ) = 2008.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 2: <keep>But we know that a2 + b2 = 2008, so substitute:</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 4: <keep>Therefore, (1000)^2 = a2 b2, so ab = 1000.</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 1: <keep>So from a2 + b2 = 2008 and ab = 1000, perhaps we can solve for a and b?</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 3: <keep>Similarly, (a - b)^2 = a2 - 2ab + b2 = 2008 - 2000 = 8.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, c + d = 1000*(sqrt(4008)/1000) = sqrt(4008).</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 2: <keep>Therefore, S = a + b + c + d = sqrt(4008) + sqrt(4008) = 2*sqrt(4008)</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 4: <keep>Therefore, 2*sqrt(4008)=2*63.3088=126.6176.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 5: <keep>Therefore, floor(S)=126.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 4: <keep>Therefore sqrt(4008)= approx 63.3088 - 0.000032≈63.30877.</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 3: <keep>sqrt(4008)=~63.30886, therefore 2*sqrt(4008)=~126.6177.</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 2: <keep>Therefore, sqrt(4008)≈63.308765</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 3: <keep>Therefore value of S=2*63.308765≈126.61753.</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 4: <keep>Therefore, floor(S)=126</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore answer is 126.</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 2: <keep>\boxed{126}</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 5: <keep>Adding these two equations, we get 2a = sqrt(4008) + sqrt(8), so a = (sqrt(4008) + sqrt(8))/2</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 6: <keep>Similarly, subtracting, 2b = sqrt(4008) - sqrt(8), so b = (sqrt(4008) - sqrt(8))/2</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 3: <keep>Given that ab = 1000 and a + b = sqrt(4008). Therefore:</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 1: <keep>But 4008 -4006.89=1.11.</keep>
