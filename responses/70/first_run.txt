Okay, I need to figure out which parts of the reasoning are crucial for reaching the final answer. Let's go step by step through the problem and the existing reasoning.

The problem is about finding the largest 7-10 double, which is a number N such that when its base-7 digits are read in base-10, they equal twice N. The example given is 51, whose base-7 is 102, and 102 in base-10 is 2*51.

The existing reasoning starts by formalizing the problem into equations involving digits in base-7 and their corresponding values in base-10. It breaks down the problem by considering different numbers of digits (m) and analyzing constraints. Key steps include:

1. **Formulating the equation**: For a number N with digits d_k...d_0 in base-7, the base-10 interpretation of these digits must equal 2N. This leads to the equation sum_{i=0}^k d_i (10^i - 2*7^i) = 0.
2. **Analyzing digit lengths (m)**: Considering numbers with different digit lengths in base-7 and whether they can satisfy the equation. For example, 3-digit numbers in base-7 (m=3) are explored extensively.
3. **Case analysis based on trailing digits (d0)**: Dividing the problem into cases where d0 (the last digit) is 0, 2, 4, or 6, as these affect the modulo operations and digit constraints.
4. **Solving for possible values**: For each case of d0, solving equations to find valid numbers and checking their base-7 representations. The solutions found include N=315, which is the largest among them.

The critical points here are the formulation of the equation, the case analysis for trailing digits, the specific solutions found for each case, and the conclusion that N=315 is the largest valid number. These steps are essential because they outline the method used to derive the answer. The detailed calculations for each case show how potential solutions are validated, but the key takeaways are the equations and constraints leading to the final answer.
