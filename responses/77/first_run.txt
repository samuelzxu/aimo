Okay, let's go through the problem step by step to figure out f(14, 52). The function f has three properties: it's symmetric, f(x,x) = x, and there's that third equation. I remember from math that functional equations sometimes relate to known functions like GCD or LCM. Let's see.

The third property says (x+y)f(x,y) = yf(x, x+y). If I rearrange it, maybe f(x,x+y) = [(x+y)/y]f(x,y). This seems recursive. If I apply this repeatedly, maybe I can reduce the arguments similar to the Euclidean algorithm. For example, starting with f(14,52), subtract 14 from 52 to get 38, then use the equation to express f(14,52) in terms of f(14,38). Repeating this process until the numbers get smaller. Wait, this seems like how GCD works, but the results here give larger values, so maybe LCM?

Testing with smaller numbers: f(2,4) using the steps. If f(2,4) = 4/2 * f(2,2) = 2*2=4. The LCM of 2 and 4 is 4. Then checking another example, f(4,6) = 6/(6-4)*f(4,2) = 3*4=12. LCM(4,6)=12. Hmm, matches. So maybe f is LCM?

If f is LCM, then f(x,y) = LCM(x,y). Let's verify the third property. Take x=3, y=5. LCM(3,5)=15. Left side: (3+5)*15=120. Right side:5*LCM(3,8)=5*24=120. It holds. Another test with x=4, y=6. LCM(4,6)=12. Left:10*12=120, Right:6*20=120. Works. So f must be LCM.

Thus, f(14,52)=LCM(14,52). Prime factors:14=2*7,52=2²*13. LCM is 2²*7*13=4*91=364. Final answer is 364.
