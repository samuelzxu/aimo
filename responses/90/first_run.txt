Okay, let's try to figure out which parts of this reasoning are essential for future steps. The problem is finding the smallest positive integer A with an odd number of digits, such that both A and B (formed by removing the middle digit of A) are divisible by 2018. 

The key steps involve understanding how A and B relate mathematically. The user breaks down A into parts based on its digits, formulates equations for divisibility, and uses modular arithmetic to find constraints. 

First, the structure of A and B is crucial. For a number with 2k+1 digits, removing the middle digit leaves B with 2k digits. The equations derived from divisibility by 2018 lead to the congruence 9N + M ≡ 0 mod 1009, where N is the first k digits and M is the middle digit. 

The critical insight here is solving for N and M using modular inverses and checking possible values for k (number of digits). The user systematically checks k=2 (5-digit numbers), k=3 (7-digit), and finally k=4 (9-digit), where a valid solution is found. 

The essential parts include the modular inverse of 9 mod 1009 being 897, leading to N ≡ 112*M mod 1009. For k=4 and M=9, N=1008, which is a valid 4-digit number. The calculation of L to satisfy B's divisibility is also key, leading to L=1928. The verification that A=100891928 and B=10081928 are indeed divisible by 2018 confirms the solution.

So, the essential tokens involve the key equations, the modular inverse calculation, the valid values of N and M for k=4, and the final verification of A and B.
