Alright, let's go through the problem step by step to identify which parts are essential for future reasoning steps.

1. **Understanding the Task**:
   - We need to find orthogonal trajectories of the given conic family \((x + 2y)^2 = a(x + y)\).
   - Determine the angle of intersection at the origin between the original family and the orthogonal trajectories.

2. **Key Steps in the Thought Process**:
   - **Expanding the Given Equation**: Expanding \((x + 2y)^2\) to \(x^2 + 4xy + 4y^2 = a(x + y)\) helps recognize the conic type (parabola) via discriminant calculation.
   - **Differentiating the Equation**: Implicit differentiation to find \(dy/dx\) for the original family is crucial for deriving the differential equation.
   - **Eliminating Parameter \(a\)**: Solving for \(a\) from the original equation and substituting into the differentiated equation is necessary to form the differential equation purely in terms of \(x\), \(y\), and \(dy/dx\).
   - **Deriving Orthogonal Trajectories**: Replacing \(dy/dx\) with its negative reciprocal and solving the resulting differential equation (linear DE) gives the orthogonal trajectories.
   - **Analyzing Tangents at Origin**: Calculating tangent lines for both families at the origin using slopes from their differential equations is essential for determining the intersection angle.

3. **Identifying Essential Tokens**:
   - **Differential Equation Derivation**:
     - The steps leading to \(dy/dx = -x / (3x + 2y)\) must be retained as they form the basis for orthogonal trajectories.
   - **Orthogonal Trajectory Solution**:
     - Solving \(dy/dx = (3x + 2y)/x\) to get \(y = Cx^2 - 3x\) is critical for the final answer.
   - **Tangent Line Analysis at Origin**:
     - Determining that the original family (non-degenerate) has tangent slope -1 and orthogonal trajectories have slope -3 at the origin is necessary for angle calculation.
   - **Angle Calculation**:
     - Using the formula for the angle between two lines with slopes -1 and -3, leading to \(\arctan(1/2)\), must be preserved.

4. **Paragraphs and Sentences to Keep**:
   - **Differentiation and Simplification**:
     - Paragraphs detailing the differentiation process and simplification to \(dy/dx = -x / (3x + 2y)\).
   - **Orthogonal DE Solution**:
     - Sentences showing the integration steps leading to \(y = Cx^2 - 3x\).
   - **Tangent Line Determination**:
     - Analysis showing both families’ tangent slopes at the origin.
   - **Angle Formula Application**:
     - Calculation using slopes -1 and -3 to find \(\arctan(1/2)\).
