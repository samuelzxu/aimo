Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem step by step. So, Jackie and Phil are each flipping three coins: two fair coins and one biased coin that lands heads with a probability of 4/7. We need to find the probability that both get the same number of heads, then express it as a reduced fraction m/n and find m + n.

First, I know that to find the probability they get the same number of heads, we need the probability distribution for the number of heads each gets. Since their flips are independent, the probability that Jackie and Phil have the same number is the sum over all k of [P(X=k)]², where X is the number of heads in one set of flips.

So the first step is calculating P(X=k) for k=0,1,2,3. The coins are two fair (1/2 chance of heads) and one biased (4/7 heads). 

Starting with k=0: All three must be tails. For fair coins, tails is 1/2 each, and for the biased coin, tails is 1 - 4/7 = 3/7. Multiplying these: (1/2)(1/2)(3/7) = 3/28.

For k=1: There are three scenarios. Each fair coin could be heads while the other two are tails, or the biased coin is heads. Calculating each:
- Two fair coins being heads: (1/2)(1/2)(3/7) = 3/28 each, so two of these sum to 6/28.
- Biased coin heads: (1/2)(1/2)(4/7) = 4/28. Total k=1 probability: 6/28 + 4/28 = 10/28 = 5/14.

k=2: Similarly, three scenarios. Two heads and one tail. The two heads could be both fair coins, or one fair and the biased. 
- Both fair heads: (1/2)(1/2)(3/7) = 3/28.
- One fair and biased heads: Two cases, each (1/2)(4/7)(1/2) = 4/28 each. Summing: 3/28 + 4/28 + 4/28 = 11/28.

k=3: All three heads. (1/2)(1/2)(4/7) = 4/28 = 1/7.

Checking these sum to 1: 3/28 + 10/28 + 11/28 + 4/28 = 28/28 = 1. Good.

Now, summing the squares of each probability:
(3/28)² + (10/28)² + (11/28)² + (4/28)² = (9 + 100 + 121 + 16)/784 = 246/784. Simplifying by dividing numerator and denominator by 2: 123/392. Since 123 and 392 have no common factors, m=123, n=392, so m + n = 515.
