Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. We need to find the area of square ABCD where points E and F lie on sides AD and BC respectively, such that BE = EF = FD = 30. 

First, I'll visualize the square and assign coordinates. Let’s place the square in a coordinate system with A at (0,0), B at (s,0), C at (s,s), and D at (0,s). Points E and F will then be at (0,e) and (s,f) respectively. 

Using the distance formula:
1. BE = sqrt(s² + e²) = 30
2. EF = sqrt(s² + (f - e)²) = 30
3. FD = sqrt(s² + (s - f)²) = 30

Squaring each equation:
1. s² + e² = 900
2. s² + (f - e)² = 900
3. s² + (s - f)² = 900

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives (f - e)² - e² = 0, leading to f = 2e. Substituting f = 2e into the third equation and simplifying, we derive a quadratic in terms of e². Solving this quadratic, we find valid solutions for e, f, and s. 

After checking for feasibility (ensuring f ≤ s and e ≤ s), we determine s = 9√10. The area of the square is s² = 810.

The key steps involve setting up the coordinate system, forming equations based on distances, solving the system to find s, and verifying the solution's validity. The critical tokens are those detailing the coordinate assignments, distance equations, algebraic manipulations leading to f=2e, and the final quadratic solution. These steps are essential as they directly lead to determining the side length and area.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 1: Let me assign coordinates to the square. Let's let point A be (0, 0), so that square ABCD has coordinates: A(0,0), B(s,0), C(s,s), D(0,s), where s is the side length we need to find.
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 3: Let's denote E as (0, e), where e is between 0 and s.
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 5: F would be at (s, f), with f between 0 and s.
