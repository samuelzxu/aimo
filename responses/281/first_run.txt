Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user needs to calculate the numerical value of Γ. Hmm, Γ usually refers to the gamma function, but without an argument, it's unclear. Alternatively, it might be the Euler-Mascheroni constant, typically denoted by γ. Since the problem mentions a numerical value, it's likely referring to the Euler-Mascheroni constant, which is approximately 0.5772. Even though Γ is uppercase, this might be a typo. The gamma function requires an argument to compute, so without it, the most plausible answer is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. I should check possible misinterpretations but settle on the constant given the context.
