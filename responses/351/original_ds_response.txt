Okay, so I need to find the number of positive integers m for which there exist nonnegative integers x0, x1, ..., x2011 such that m^{x0} equals the sum from k=1 to 2011 of m^{x_k}. 

Hmm, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We are supposed to find all positive integers m where we can find exponents x0, x1, ..., x20  such that when you take m raised to each of those exponents, the sum of the terms from x1 to x2011 equals m^{x0}. So like, m^{x0} is the sum of 2011 terms, each of which is m to some power, possibly different for each term. And all the exponents x0 to x201 are nonnegative integers. Alright.

So the challenge is, which m allow such an equation. I need to count how many m's there are. So maybe first, try small values of m and see patterns?

Let me start with m=1. Since 1 raised to any power is 1. So then both sides: the left-hand side is 1^{x0} =1. The right-hand side is sum_{k=1}^2011 1^{x_k} = 2011*1 =2011. So unless 1=2011, which is false. So m=1 is impossible. Therefore m=1 is excluded.

Next, m=2. Let's see. Maybe base 2 representations? If we can express 2^{x0} as the sum of 2011 terms each of which is a power of 2. Since the sum is 2^{x0}, each term on the right must be less than or equal to 2^{x0}, but the total needs to add up to 2^{x0}.

But each term is 2^{x_k}, so to sum to 2^{x0}, each term could be up to 2^{x0}, but we have 2011 terms. For example, since 2^{x0} is just adding 1 term of 2^{x0}, but here we need 2011 terms. 

Alternatively, consider that in binary, 2^{x0} is a 1 followed by x0 zeros. Whereas the sum of 2011 terms each of which is a power of 2 would have coefficients when written in binary, each digit being the number of times that power is used. So in this case, the right-hand side would need to be 2011 terms of distinct powers? Wait, but the exponents can be repeated. So in binary, when you add numbers, you can have carries. But here, maybe we can have multiple terms with the same exponent.

But the key point is that each term in the sum is of the form m^{x_k}. If m=2, then those are 2^{x_k}, which when summed, in binary, would represent some number. But to get exactly 2^{x0}. But 2^{x0} in binary is a 1 followed by x0 zeros. So how could the sum of multiple 2^{x_k} terms give a single 1 followed by zeros? Well, only if all but one of the terms are zero? But in the sum from k=1 to 2011 terms. Wait, but if any x_k is 0, then 2^{0}=1, but that would mean there's a 1 in the 1's place in binary. Similarly for other exponents. So if we have to add a bunch of powers of 2 to get another power of 2, then all digits in the binary representation of the sum must be 0 except for one digit. So we have to check if 2^{x0} can be represented as a sum of 2011 powers of 2, possibly repeated.

Wait, for example, suppose x0 is large enough so that 2^{x0} can be written as the sum of 2011 terms each less than or equal to 2^{x0}. Then, it's possible if for the coefficient in each binary digit to not carry over. Let me think. If you sum, say, 2^{x0 -1} + 2^{x0 -1} = 2^{x0}, which is two terms. But here, we have 2011 terms, so how?

Well, if x0 is at least, say, some t, then you can distribute the exponent x0-1 such that you have 2^{x0} written as sum of 2's?

Wait, maybe. Wait, here's the alternative: If you take m = 2, then m^something is a power of 2. The key thing is that the sum on the right has 2011 terms. 2011 is odd. The left-hand side is a single power of 2, so it's even, except when x0 is 0, then it's 1. But 1 cannot be written as the sum of 2011 powers of 2. Because each power of 2 is at least 1 (when x=0 for 2^0, which is 1) so 2011 times 1 is 2011, which is way bigger. So even for x0=0, how?

Wait wait, but to even get 2^{x0} as sum_{k=1}^{2011} 2^{x_k}, we need that sum of powers of 2 equals another power of 2. In particular, when you sum several powers of 2 together, you get a number which is not a power of 2, unless you just add a power of 2 once. But, but here, adding multiple times.

Wait, but if you allow repeated exponents, could you for example add multiples of the same term. Let's think. For example, 2^{x} added 2^{x} times is... but that gets over the base. For example, 2^{x} added 2^{x} times would be 2^{x} *2^{x}=2^{2x}. Wait, but that's not how it works. If you have multiple terms, you just add them. So, 2^{x} added m times is m * 2^{x}.

So then, the sum is equal to m^{x_0} only if there is some exponent x_0 such that m^{x_0} can be written as a sum of 2011 terms of power of 2. However, m=2 here. So 2^{x_0} must be equal to the sum of 2011 terms of 2^{x_k}, each xk a non-negative integer.

Alternatively, m^{x_0} is equal to a sum of 2011 m^{x_k} terms. So if m=2 and I have 2011 terms of 2^something adding to 2^{x0}.

But how can this happen? The left-hand side is a power of 2. The right-hand side, the sum of several powers of 2. Now, a sum of even numbers (if xk >=1) would be even, and sum of an odd number of odd numbers (if xk=0, which gives 1, which is odd) would be odd. So if x0=0, then left is 1, which is odd. So the sum must have an odd number of 1s, and maybe other even terms. But 2011 already is odd, so if all other terms are even (i.e., exponents >=1), then the entire sum would be odd: 2011 is odd, and hence if sum consists of possibly some 1's (odds) and even numbers, the total sum would be congruent to number of 1's modulo 2. So to get 1, which is congruent to 1 mod 2, so number of 1s must be odd. But 2011 is the total number of terms, so if we use t terms of exponent 0 (each is 1), and (2011 - t) terms of exponent >=1.

But 1 is the left-hand side. So let's see:

Left-hand side: 1.

Right-hand side: t*1 + (2011 - t)*even. So even + t*1. To sum to 1, we need:

even + t*1 =1.

Even + t*1 is t*1 mod 2, which must equal 1. Therefore t must be odd. So t is an odd number between 1 and 2011. But then, t*1 is at least 1, and 2011 - t terms of even numbers. The sum is t + ... So even if t=1 and the rest terms (2010) are even, sum is 1 + even, which is 1 + even. So if I set 2010 terms to 2^0=1? Wait, no, the rest terms need to be 2^{x_k} where xk >=1. So each of those terms is even, 2^1=2, 2^2=4, etc. So 2010 terms must be even. Then the sum to 1. There's no way, because the even sum is at least 2010*2 = 4020, and t is at least 1, so total sum would be 1 + 4020=4021, not 1. Therefore no possible. So m=2 doesn't work for x0=0, how about x0>=1.

Suppose x0 >=1, so left is 2^{x0}. Right-hand side is sum of 2011 terms. Each term is 2^{x_k}, xk non-negative. Let's consider how such a sum can equal a power of 2.

In base 2, the left-hand side is 100...0, so the sum must produce exactly that. However, sum_terms is 2011 numbers, each 0 or 1 in each bit except in different positions. Wait no, each term is a power of 2, so like when expressed in binary, positions of 1s. But the sum is adding 2011 such numbers. So in binary, each bit can be the number of times that 2^bit appears in the sum.

For example, if the sum in each binary digit is 1 (from the left) and possibly carries, but to get an exact power of 2, all the sums need to result in just one 1 and all others 0. But carries would complicate this.

Alternatively, to get a power of 2, say 2^{x0}, with 2011 terms of power of 2. Suppose that all 2011 terms except one are equal to 0? Wait, not possible, because if exponent is non-negative integer. If some term's exponent is negative? No, x_k is non-negative. Only possible power to reach 0 is with m>0, but  m=2>0 but 2^{x_k} is never zero. So all terms are at least 1. Therefore, the sum is 2011 terms each at least 1, but that sum is 2011*1=2011 at minimum. The left-hand side is 2^{x0} so it must be at least as big as 2011. Then m=2's minimal left-hand side possible is in this scenario where left-hand side is at least 2011, but as a power of 2. The minimal x0 would be that 2^{x0} ≥2011. So x0=11, since 2^11=2048. So possible? Let's check if 2048 can be written as the sum of 2011 terms, each of which is a power of 2 (at least 1). So perhaps 2048= sum_{k=1}^2011 2^{x_k}. If so, since all terms are 1 or higher, the minimal sum would be 2011*1=2011 and maximal sum would be 2011*... Well, as the exponents go up.

But in order to sum to 2048, perhaps take as 2048=2^11. So we have 2011 terms. If we take 2011- t terms as 1 and t terms as 2^something higher. 2048= (2011 - t)*1 + t*(2^s). What should t and s be?

So 2048=2011 -t + t*2^s. Then, 2048 -2011= t*(2^s -1) which is 37= t*(2^s -1). So t must divide 37, and 2^s-1 divides 37. Since 37 is prime, possible options are t=1, s such that 2^s -1=37 ⇒ s=6 (since 2^6=64-1=63≠37. Wait, 2^s=38, which 37. So not possible. Alternatively, t=37, s=1. 2^1 -1=1, then 37*1=37 which fits. Then: 2048= (2011 -37)*1 +37*(2^1). So 2011 -37=1974. 1974*1 +37*2=1974 +74=2048. Yes, that works. So yes, m=2 possible. x0=11, xk for 1974 terms being 0 (since 2^0=1) and 37 terms of xk=1 (2^1=2). Hence, m=2 is acceptable.

So m=2 is okay.

Similarly, m=3. What here?

We need 3^{x0} = sum_{k=1}^2011 3^{x_k}.

Similar idea. Perhaps similar construction. Let's suppose we take x0 such that the sum can be achieved.

Again, let’s consider the minimal case. Because each term is at least 1 (3^0=1) so sum must be at least 2011. So 3^{x0} ≥2011. So x0 must be such that 3^{x0} ≥2011. Calculating 3^6=729, 3^7=2187. So minimal x0=7. Since 3^7=2187.

Then, similar to how we did m=2: Let 2187= sum_{k=1}^{2011}3^{x_k}. Then, how?

We can have: use 3^{1}=3, and we need (assuming)

Split 2011 terms into t copies of 3 and (2011 -t) copies of 1. Then the total sum would be 3t +1*(2011 - t)= 2011 +2t. We need this to equal 2187. So 2011 + 2t=2187. Thus, 2t=2187-2011=176. Hence t=88. So 88*3 + (2011 -88)*1. Let me check 88*3=264, 2011 -88=1923. 264 + 1923= 2187. Thus yes, 3^{7}= 3^1 added 88 times plus 3^0 added 1923 times. So, yes, m=3 is possible, with x0=7, and 88 exponents xk=1, and 1923 exponents xk=0.

Similarly, m=4.

So, in general, when m is arbitrary, to solve m^{x0} = sum_{k=1}^{2011} m^{x_k}.

The approach is to set x0 so that m^{x0} ≥2011 (since each term is at least m^0 =1). Let’s choose x0 as the minimal such that m^{x0} ≥2011. Then, since m^{x0} -2011 must be expressible as a linear combination of m^{x} -1 terms, maybe using m's coefficients?

Wait, but maybe there's a more straightforward way to see. For example, for m, and x0 minimal such that m^{x0} ≥2011, then m^{x0} -2011 must be divisible by (m -1). Let me think. Since, in order for m^{x0} -2011 = Sum_{k=1}^{2011} (m^{x_k}) -2011*1. Wait, but if x_k =0, then term is 1, else a higher power.

Alternatively, suppose we take a number of higher exponents and 1s.

For m:

Express m^{x0} as sum_{k=1}^{2011} m^{x_k}.

Let us consider as follows.

We can use 2011 terms where as many as possible are 1 (i.e., m^0), and the rest are higher powers. If I set t terms as m^1 and 2011 -t terms as m^0=1. Then sum is t*m + (2011 -t)*1. We need to have t*m + (2011 -t) = m^{x0}. Let's think of choosing x0=2, which would require t*m + (2011 -t) = m^2. Let t = something, e.g., solving for t: t(m -1) = m^2 -2011. So m^2 -2011 has to be divisible by m-1. Thus:

m^2 -2011 = (m -1)(m +1 + ... ) Wait, as polynomial division, we can divide m^2-2011 by m-1. m^2 - 2011 = (m-1)(m + 1) + ( -2010 )

Wait, let's check. Let m-1 divide m^2 -2011. Then, m^2 -2011 ≡0 mod m -1. If m≡1 mod m-1, then substitute m=1 into m^2 -2011 =1 -2011= -2010. For m-1 to divide, m^2 -2011 ≡0 mod m -1 ⇒ -2010 ≡0 mod m -1 ⇒ m -1 divides -2010.

But since m is positive integer, m–1 must divide 2010.

So m-1 divides 2010, so m-1 is a positive divisor of 2010. Then m is t+1 with t |2010.

So if x0=2, then m must satisfy that m-1 divides 2010.

Moreover, once m^2 = sum= t*m + (2011 -t). So that t= (m^2 -2011)/ (m-1). We need t to be integer, and non-negative, and 2011 -t ≥0. So m^2 -2011 must be divisible by m -1. Hence, m -1 divides 2010, as above.

But is x0=2 the minimal possible?

Alternatively, for some m, could we have x0 >2? For example, if m is greater?

But in order for m^{x0} to be expressible, suppose m is large enough such that m^{x0} -s*(m) =2011 -t, but perhaps this is unclear. But my previous concept for x0=2 seems more direct.

Halt. Let me try concrete m again. Let me think of m=2: Earlier, done, successfully. For m=2, x0=11. For m=3, x0=7.

Wait, why did we need different x0? Because for m=2, the minimal x0 is when 2^x0 >=2011, as we did 2^11=2048.

For m=3, 3^7=2187, which is first above 2011.

But, but m=43, let's say m=44? Perhaps thinking m is large.

Alternatively, perhaps a pattern where m^{x0} must be equal to sum_{k=1}^{2011} m^{x_k}. If x0 is the minimal exponent where m^{x0} >=2011, but then m^{x0} -2011 will need to be grouped with multiples of m, m^2, etc., which sum as coefficients.

Wait, not sure.

Wait, when m is larger, m=2012. Then m^1=2012. Then sum_{k=1}^{2011} m^{x_k}. If we take sum as 2011 terms of m^0=1 each: sum is 2011, which is less than 2012. So cannot get m^1. Maybe m^1=2012. Alternatively, take x0=1, and if sum_{k=1}^{2011} m^{x_k}= m^1. Then sum must be m=2011*1 + (terms involving m, m^2, etc.), but to equal to m. So the extra terms: some terms m^{x_k} where xk >=1. However, each such term is at least m. So 2011 + (number of higher terms) *m >=2011 + m. If you have even one term with xk >=1, the sum increases by m -1 (from replacing a 1 with m). Therefore, suppose you took s terms of m. Then sum is (2011 -s)*1 +s*m. Then set equal to m^{x0}.

Suppose x0=1. Then m^{1}=m. The equation would be (2011 -s)*1 +s*m =m. Which implies 2011 -s =0. Hence s=2011, so 2011 m's.

But 2011* m = m, implies 2010*m=0, which is impossible. So x0 must be at least 2. Next, if x0=2: m^2 =sum, which would include (2011 -s) *1 + s*m. Set as m^2 =2011 -s +s*m.

Thus, s*(m -1) =m^2 -2011. So s=(m^2 -2011)/(m -1). This must be integer. As before.

Wait, same as the equation here. So we go back to the same divisor as before. Hmm. So yeah, perhaps for m >=2, x0=2 is possible when m-1 divides m^2 -2011, which equates to m –1 divides 2010. So similar to for x0=2, requiring that.

But earlier, m=2 yielded x0=11, which isn't 2. So apparently, perhaps this reasoning isn't accurate. Wait m=2 is possible with x0=11. Then this indicates that for those m which maybe do not divide, but have larger exponents, the equation is still possible.

Wait, maybe earlier reasoning for x0=2 didn't necessarily hold for all m, but there are two separate cases: m where m-1 divides 2010, so you can construct x0=2, and m where you need higher exponents. But but perhaps, is m^2 being equal to t*m + (2011 -t) for some t? For m=2: if x0=2, left side is 4, right side would have t*2 + (2011 -t) =4. So 2t +2011 -t =t +2011=4. But t +2011=4 → t=-2007. Impossible.  So for m=2, higher x0 is needed.

But earlier with m=2, we used x0=11 where S=2048=1974*1+37*2. So t=37, s=(mx0 - sum)/... Ah, different exponents. So perhaps the idea for general m:

The number m^{x0} can be written as the combination of terms where most of the terms are 1's (m0) and some higher terms. For m^2, trying something similar.

But in general, for an arbitrary m with x0 as minimal such that m^{x0} ≥2011 and that m^{x0} -2011 is divisible by m -1, given m≥2.

Wait, m^{x0} ≡2011 mod m-1.

Since m≡1 mod m-1, so m^{x0}≡1 mod m-1. Then 1 ≡2011 mod m-1. Therefore, m-1 divides 2010. So for the equation m^{x0}= sum_{k=1}^{2011}m^{x_k}, it must be that m-1 divides 2010.

Wait, similar to before?

Wait for m to satisfy m^{x0} = sum_{k=1}^{2011}m^{x_k}, then modulo m -1, both sides:

Left side: m^{x0}≡1 mod m -1.

Right side: sum_{k=1}^{2011}m^{x_k} ≡sum_{k=1}^{2011} 1^{x_k} ≡2011*1 ≡2011 mod m -1.

Thus, 1≡2011 mod (m-1). Hence, m -1 divides 2010. So m -1 divides 2010. Thus, for m to satisfy the equation, we must have m -1 is a positive divisor of 2010. Therefore m =d +1 where d is a positive divisor of 2010 (and m >= 2). Therefore, the number of positive integers m is equal to the number of positive divisors of 2010.

But the problem states "positive integers m". Therefore, the answer is τ(2010), the number of positive divisors of 2010. But I need to be careful: is every divisor d of 2010, m= d +1 can achieve the equation? Even with larger divisors.

Wait, let me verify this with m=2, which is a valid case. Since 2010=2*3*5*67, then the divisors are d=1. So m=1 +1=2. Indeed. But they are also other divisors. For example, 2010=2*3*5*67. So divisors:

1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30,67,134,201,335,402,670,1005,2010

Thus, corresponding m's:

2,3,4,6,7,11,16,31,68,135,202,336,403,671,1006,2011.

So τ(2010)=16. So m-1 must be a divisor of 2010, so m= d +1 where d divides 2010. Hence, 16 values.

But the important question is, are all those m's allowed? For example, take m=2011, which would correspond to d=2010, a divisor. Then, m=2011 +1=2011 +1=2012? Wait, since d is a divisor of 2010; no, d can be up to 2010. So m=2010 +1=2011.

Wait:

d=1 → m=2,

d=2→m=3,...

d=2010→m=2011.

So the maximum m is 2011.

Is m=2011 acceptable?

Let's check: For m=2011.

We need 2011^{x0} = sum_{k=1}^{2011}2011^{xk}.

If x0=1, then left-hand side is 2011. Right-hand side is sum of 2011 terms, each of which is at least 1. The minimal sum is 2011*1=2011. Hence, taking xk=0 for all k. Thus sum_{k=0}^{2011}2011^{0}=2011*1=2011=2011^{1}. So m=2011 works with x0=1, all others xk=0.

Similarly, for m=134 +1=135. Then, does the same logic apply? I.E., if m-1 divides 2010, then x0=1:

sum_{k=1}^{2011}m^{x_k} where all xk=0. Then sum is 1*2011. we have left-hand side as m^{x0}=m.

But 2011 in terms of m to power 1? if m=135, but 135≠2011. So m=135 cannot be written as 2011*1. So how?

Ah, but perhaps the previous argument is incorrect. Wait no:

Wait, hold on: the requirement is that m -1 divides 2010 → 2010≡0 mod (m -1). But also, since m^{x0} = sum_{k=1}^{2011}m^{x_k}, which under modulo m -1 gives 1 ≡2011 mod mm-1 as before, hence m -1 divides 2010. So this is a necessary condition.

But is it sufficient? I think maybe, once we have established that m-1 divides 2010, then possible solutions.

But let's take m=3, which m-1= 2, divides 2010. m=3: works using x0=7.

But m=2011: just using xk=0 and m=2011^{1}=2011*1.

But in general, for m where m-1 divides 2010, can we write m^{x} as sum. Hmm. So when m -1 divides2010, then m^{x0} can be written as t*m + (2011 - t), with xk=1 and xk=0.

This is possible for x0=2. So, following the previous idea: for x0 to be minimal or some x0, it is possible.

But Wait, if for m=3, you can set m=3, equation 3^{7}= sum of 2011 terms. But alternatively, setting x0=2. m -1=2 divides 2010. Then m=3, m -1=2 divides2010, (True). Then So if m=3, let's look at x0=2.

Left side: m^{2} =9. Right side sum of t*3 + (2011 -t)*1 =3t +2011 -t =2t +2011. Set 2t+2011=9. But 2t= -2002 ⇒ no. Not possible. So x0 can't be 2 here. So the prior reasoning was not exactly a true fit. Therefore something isn't working. So m-1 dividing 2010 is a necessary condition but perhaps not sufficient.

Hence, the problem requires more careful consideration.

But the key here is that regardless of x0, we need that m x0 and exponent positions such that m^{x_0} can be written as a sum of 2011 m^{x_k}. 

From the necessary condition identified earlier: modulo m-1, left-hand side is 1, right-hand side is 2011. So congruence 1≡2011 mod m−1 ∴2010≡0 mod m−1. Therefore m−1 must divide 2010 →m−1 is a divisor of2010. So necessary condition is m−1 divides2010. Therefore, positive m satisfy m−1/ |2010, hence τ(2010) possible m. However, the m=3 case shows that even with m−1 dividing2010, a small m may yet use a larger x0. However ,the problem says "there exists some choice of x0,...,x_{2011}" with exponents as non-negative integers. So technically: For each m where m-1 /2010, we can have x0=1?

Wait no. In m=3‘s case,x0=1 cannot happen because 3 ≠ sum_{k=1}^{2011}3^{x_k}, since 3 requires only 3 =sum of terms. The minimal sum when all xk=0 is 2011*1=2011, which is higher. Therefore in such cases, the minimal left-hand side must be higher. Thus, the necessity.

So, if m-1 divides 2010, the equation m^{x}= (sum over m terms) can have higher x. The problem is it's existence, so once m-1 divides 2010, it's possible.

Alternatively, here is a different Approach:

Let me note that the problem generalizes to the following: for given integer s (here 2011), find the number of m where m^{x} can be written as sum of s terms each m^{y}

To formalize, the equation a^b = a^{c_1} + a^{c_2} + ... +a^{c_s}. Your problem is with s=2011.

The work I did before suggests the necessary condition is m-1 divides s (here, 2010, since 2010=2011-1 was confused here). Wait, earlier I made that congruent?

Wait, modulo m-1.

Given the equation m^{x0} = sum_{k=1}^{2011}m^{x_k}.

Then modulo m−1, LHS: (1)^{x0}≡1 (because m≡1 mod m−1, so m^{x}≡1^{x}≡1)

RHS: sum_{k=1}^{2011}1^{x_k}≡2011 mod m−1.

Therefore: 1≡ 2011 mod m−1 ⇒2010 ≡0 mod m−1⇒m−1 divides2010.

So hence, necessary condition: m−1 divides2010. And perhaps m>1 (but m=2 case is already included here.)

But what about m=2011. That is m –1=2010 divides2010=>yes, so it's acceptable.

Indeed, m=2011 is feasible, using x0=1 as the sum of 2011 of m^0=1, sum=2011.0 m^{0}=2011*1=2011, which equals m^1=2011.

Similarly, if m−1 divides2010. So let’s check m=3:

m−1=2 (div2010). So need x0=?:

Set t number of m’s and 2011 -t number of1’s. Then:

3^{x0}= t*3 + (2011 -t)

Which was what done before, that with x0=7, solving 3^7=?

3^7=2187, which is = t*3 + (2011 −t). Solving for t: 3t +2011 - t =2t +2011=2187. So 2t=176 ⇒t=88. Therefore, 88*3 +1923*1 =2187. So done.

Similarly, m= 67−1=66. Wait, m=68, since m−1=67, divides2010? 2010/67 is approx30. 67*30=2010. So yes, since divisors include67 and 67*?=2010.

Wait, 2010 divided by67: 2010 ÷67= approx 30. So 67*30=2010. Hence, m=68 has m−1=67,divides2010. Let's check if m=68 is feasible.

For m=68:

We need to have sum_{k=1}^{2011}68^{x_k}=68^{x0}.

Take x0=2. Then the sum required is 682=4624.

Set up the equation 4624= t*68 +(2011 −t)*1.

Thus,4624=67t +2011. Hence,67t=4624−2011=2613. →t=2613/67=39.

Hence, t=39. Therefore, Sum is39*68 +(2011−39)*1=39*68 +1972*1=39×68=2652; 2652 +1972=4624=682. Yes. That works. So take m=68, x0=2, use 39 terms of x_k=1 and 1972 terms of x1=0 ⇒ sum=68^2=4624.

Hence, yes satisfies equation.

Further, if m=2011, m−1=2010 divides2010, which it does. As such, the case for m=2011 uses x0=1, sum_{}2011 terms of m=2011^0=1.

Therefore Indeed, every m where m−1 divides2010 can be written in such a way. Thus, Number of m is same as Number of positive divisors of2010. Since m−1 must divide2010, m'=m-1 is a positive divisor of2010. Therefore,m numbers are d+1 for each divisor d of2010.

Since 2010 factors as 2×3×5×67. Therefore, number of positive divisors is (1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)=16.

Therefore, there are 16 positive divisors of2010, which corresponding m's are d+1 for each such divisor. Hence, answer is16.

But need to verify if each such m works. But as verified with m=2,m=3,m=68,m=2011 cases above: Yes, if m−1 divides2010. Hence, since these cases work, and divisor setup is always possible with:

If m−1 divides2010, the equation LHS = sum_{k=1}^{s} term. m^{x}=sum_{k=1}^{s}m x_k. As generalizable, m^{x}= (t)m + (s -t)1. Solving for t=(m^{x} -s)/(m -1). When you set x such that m^{x} ≥s, and m^{x} ≡s mod m-1. Since m-1 divides2010, the computation comes up whole, so t is integer.

Thus, for any m where m−1 divides2010, you choose the smallest x such that m^x ≥2011, and then m^{x} -2011 is divisible by m-1. Thus t=(m^x -2011)/(m-1) is an integer. Since m^x ≥2011 and m≥1, so m^x can be made as large as desired (even here, at least m^log_m(2011)), so for each such m, there exists some x such that t is integer, hence the equation works.

Therefore, all these m’s work, totaling the number of divisors of2010, which is16. So the answer is16. Thus, the answer must be \boxed{16}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{16}
