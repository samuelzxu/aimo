Okay, let's try to figure out which parts of the reasoning are essential to keep for future steps. The key idea here is that the number of valid integers m is equal to the number of divisors of 2010. The reasoning goes through several steps to reach this conclusion, but we need to identify the critical parts that lead to this result.

First, the necessary condition that m−1 must divide 2010 is derived from modular arithmetic considerations. This is a crucial step because it reduces the problem to finding divisors of 2010. 

Then, the factorization of 2010 into primes (2×3×5×67) and the calculation of the number of divisors based on the exponents of the prime factors is another critical part. This directly gives the count of 16 divisors.

Specific examples like m=2, m=3, and m=2011 illustrate how the equation is satisfied for different values, confirming that the necessary condition is also sufficient. These examples validate the approach but might not all be essential to retain. However, the general proof that each divisor leads to a valid m is important.

The final conclusion that the number of valid m is the number of divisors of 2010, which is 16, is obviously essential.

Now, let's mark the essential parts:

1. The modular arithmetic step establishing m−1 divides 2010.
2. The factorization of 2010.
3. Calculation of the number of divisors.
4. The final conclusion.

Each of these steps is critical for understanding why the answer is 16. Examples are helpful but may not all be necessary if the general proof is kept.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 1: <keep>So the challenge is, which m allow such an equation. I need to count how many m's there are.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 1: <keep>So m=1 is impossible. Therefore m=1 is excluded.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 1: <keep>So the key point is that each term in the sum is of the form m^{x_k}. If m=2, then those are 2^{x_k}, which when summed, in binary, would represent some number.</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 1: <keep>So the key thing is that the sum on the right has 2011 terms. 2011 is odd. The left-hand side is a single power of 2, so it's even, except when x0 is 0, then it's 1. But 1 cannot be written as the sum of 2011 powers of 2.</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 1: <keep>So 2048= (2011 - t)*1 + t*(2^s). What should t and s be?</keep>
- Paragraph 14, Sentence 1: <keep>Then, 2048 -2011= t*(2^s -1) which is 37= t*(2^s -1). So t must divide 37, and 2^s-1 divides 37. Since 37 is prime, possible options are t=1, s such that 2^s -1=37 ⇒ s=6 (since 2^6=64-1=63≠37. Wait, 2^s=38, which 37. So not possible. Alternatively, t=37, s=1. 2^1 -1=1, then 37*1=37 which fits. Then: 2048= (2011 -37)*1 +37*(2^1). So 2011 -37=1974. 1974*1 +37*2=1974 +74=2048. Yes, that works. So yes, m=2 possible.</keep>
- Paragraph 15, Sentence 1: <keep>Similarly, m=3. What here?</keep>
- Paragraph 16, Sentence 1: <keep>We need 3^{x0} = sum_{k=1}^2011 3^{x_k}. Similar idea. Perhaps similar construction.</keep>
- Paragraph 18, Sentence 1: <keep>So 2011 + 2t=2187. Thus, 2t=2187-2011=176. Hence t=88. So 88*3 + (2011 -88)*1. Let me check 88*3=264, 2011 -88=1923. 264 + 1923= 2187. Thus yes, 3^{7}= 3^1 added 88 times plus 3^0 added 1923 times. So, yes, m=3 is possible.</keep>
- Paragraph 22, Sentence 1: <keep>But in general, for m: Express m^{x0} as sum_{k=1}^{2011} m^{x_k}. Let us consider as follows.</keep>
- Paragraph 23, Sentence 1: <keep>If x0=1. Then m^{1}=m. The equation would be (2011 -s)*1 +s*m =m. Which implies 2011 -s =0. Hence s=2011, so 2011 m's.</keep>
- Paragraph 24, Sentence 1: <keep>Thus, s*(m -1) =m^2 -2011. So s=(m^2 -2011)/(m -1). This must be integer. As before.</keep>
- Paragraph 25, Sentence 1: <keep>Wait, m^{x0} ≡2011 mod (m-1). Since m≡1 mod m-1, so m^{x0}≡1 mod m-1. Then 1 ≡2011 mod m-1. Therefore, m-1 divides 2010.</keep>
- Paragraph 26, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, for m to satisfy the equation, we must have m -1 is a positive divisor of 2010. Therefore m =d +1 where d is a positive divisor of 2010 (and m >= 2). Therefore, the number of positive integers m is equal to the number of positive divisors of 2010.</keep>
- Paragraph 27, Sentence 1: <keep>1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30,67,134,201,335,402,670,1005,2010 Thus, corresponding m's: 2,3,4,6,7,11,16,31,68,135,202,336,403,671,1006,2011.</keep>
- Paragraph 28, Sentence 1: <keep>But the important question is, are all those m's allowed? For example, take m=2011, which would correspond to d=2010, a divisor. Then, m=2011 works with x0=1, all others xk=0.</keep>
- Paragraph 30, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore Indeed, every m where m−1 divides2010 can be written in such a way. Thus, Number of m is same as Number of positive divisors of2010. Since m−1 must divide2010, m'=m-1 is a positive divisor of2010. Therefore,m numbers are d+1 for each divisor d of2010.</keep>
- Paragraph 31, Sentence 1: <keep>Since 2010 factors as 2×3×5×67. Therefore, number of positive divisors is (1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)=16.</keep>
- Paragraph 32, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, answer is \boxed{16}.</keep>
