Alright, let's start by understanding the problem. We need to find the 5n-th lucky number where n is the position of 2005 in the sequence of lucky numbers. Lucky numbers have digits that sum to 7.

First, confirm that 2005 is a lucky number: 2 + 0 + 0 + 5 = 7. So it is.

Next, determine n by counting all lucky numbers less than 2005. These include:
- 1-digit: 7 (1 number)
- 2-digit: 7 numbers (16, 25, 34, 43, 52, 61, 70)
- 3-digit: 28 numbers (calculated using stars and bars)
- 4-digit: Numbers from 1000-1999 (28 numbers) and 2000-2004 (none valid), totaling 28.

Adding these up: 1 + 7 + 28 + 28 = 64. Thus, n = 64 + 1 = 65.

We need a_{5n} = a_{325}. Now, count lucky numbers up to each digit length:
- 1-digit: 1
- 2-digit: 8
- 3-digit: 36
- 4-digit: 120
- 5-digit: 330

Since 325 falls within 5-digit numbers (positions 121-330), calculate the 205th 5-digit lucky number. Break down the 5-digit counts by first digit:
- d1=1: 84
- d1=2: 56
- d1=3: 35
- d1=4: 20
- d1=5: 10 (summing to 205th)

The 205th number is the last in d1=5, which is 52000 (sum 5+2+0+0+0=7).

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 4: <keep>n is the position of 2005 in the sequence of lucky numbers. A lucky number is defined as a number whose digits sum to 7.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 1: <keep>first, I need to determine the value of n such that a_n = 2005, and then find a_{5n}.</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 1: <keep>Confirm that 2005 is indeed a lucky number. Adding its digits: 2 + 0 + 0 + 5 = 7. Yes, that works. So 2005 is a lucky number.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 1: <keep>Second Step: We need to find n, which is the position of 2005 in the ordered list of lucky numbers.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 1: <keep>To find n, we need to count all lucky numbers less than 2005.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 1: <keep>1-Digit Lucky Numbers: Only the number 7. So that's 1 number.</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 1: <keep>2-Digit Lucky Numbers: These are numbers from 10 to 99 where the sum of digits is 7.</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 1: <keep>7 numbers: 16, 25, 34, 43, 52, 61, 70. So 7 numbers.</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 1: <keep>3-Digit Lucky Numbers: Numbers from 100 to 999 where sum is 7.</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentence 1: <keep>Total three-digit lucky numbers:7+6+5+4+3+2+1=28. Correct.</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 1: <keep>4-Digit Lucky Numbers: Now, four-digit numbers from 1000 to 1999 (i.e., starting with 1).</keep>
- Paragraph 14, Sentence 1: <keep>numbers starting with 1 (1000-1999) have remaining three digits sum to 6, counted via stars and bars: 28 numbers.</keep>
- Paragraph 15, Sentence 1: <keep>numbers from 2000 to 2004: none have digit sum 7. Total four-digit lucky numbers less than 2005:28.</keep>
- Paragraph 16, Sentence 1: <keep>Total lucky numbers less than 2005: 1 (1-digit) +7 (2-digit)+28 (3-digit)+28 (4-digit)=64. Thus, n=64+1=65.</keep>
- Paragraph 17, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, a_{5n}=a_{325}. Need to find the 325th lucky number.</keep>
- Paragraph 18, Sentence 1: <keep>Cumulative counts: up to 4-digit:120. 5-digit numbers total 210. So a_{325} is the 205th 5-digit lucky number.</keep>
- Paragraph 19, Sentence 1: <keep>Break down 5-digit counts by first digit: d1=1 (84), d1=2 (56), d1=3 (35), d1=4 (20), d1=5 (10).</keep>
- Paragraph 20, Sentence 1: <keep>205th number falls in d1=5 group. This group has numbers with remaining four digits summing to 2.</keep>
- Paragraph 21, Sentence 1: <keep>Order of numbers in d1=5 group: 50002, 50011, 50020, 50101, 50110, 50200, 51001, 51010, 51100, 52000.</keep>
- Paragraph 22, Sentence 1: <keep>205th number is the 10th in d1=5 group: 52000. Thus, a_{325}=52000.</keep>
