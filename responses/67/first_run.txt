Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is about finding the eighth term of a sequence formed by multiplying terms from two arithmetic sequences. The given terms are 1440, 1716, 1848, and so on.

First, I recall that an arithmetic sequence has a common difference. Let's denote the two arithmetic sequences as {a_n} and {b_n}. The given sequence {c_n} is their product, so c_n = a_n * b_n. Each term in {c_n} is the product of the corresponding terms from {a_n} and {b_n}.

Given:
- c₁ = 1440 = a₁ * b₁
- c₂ = 1716 = a₂ * b₂
- c₃ = 1848 = a₃ * b₃

Since {a_n} and {b_n} are arithmetic sequences, we can express them as:
- a_n = a + (n-1)d
- b_n = p + (n-1)q

Expanding c_n:
c_n = (a + (n-1)d)(p + (n-1)q)

Expanding this product gives a quadratic function in terms of n. Therefore, c_n can be expressed as a quadratic function:
c_n = An² + Bn + C

Using the given terms, we set up equations:
1. A + B + C = 1440
2. 4A + 2B + C = 1716
3. 9A + 3B + C = 1848

Solving these equations:
- Subtracting equation 1 from 2: 3A + B = 276
- Subtracting equation 2 from 3: 5A + B = 132
- Subtracting these results: 2A = -144 ⇒ A = -72
- Substituting A back: B = 492
- Substituting A and B into equation 1: C = 1020

Thus, c_n = -72n² + 492n + 1020. Plugging in n = 8 gives the eighth term:
c₈ = -72(8²) + 492(8) + 1020 = -4608 + 3936 + 1020 = 348

To confirm, we factor the quadratic into two arithmetic sequences. Solving the system of equations for a, d, p, q confirms that the eighth term is indeed 348.

Key steps include recognizing the quadratic nature of {c_n}, solving the system, verifying through factoring into arithmetic sequences, and confirming with substitution.
