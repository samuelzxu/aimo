Alright, let's start by understanding what the user needs. The problem is to find the minimum value of S(t)/√t, where S(t) is the area bounded by two tangent lines to the parabola y = x² from the point (t, -1) and the parabola itself. The user has provided a detailed reasoning trace, and now I need to identify which tokens are essential for future reasoning steps, marking them with <keep> tags.

First, the initial steps involve finding the equations of the tangent lines. The user derives the tangent lines at points (a, a²) on the parabola, leading to the quadratic equation in a: a² - 2ta - 1 = 0. The roots of this equation give the x-coordinates of the points of tangency, a₁ and a₂. These roots are crucial because they determine the points where the tangent lines touch the parabola, so marking these parts is essential.

Next, the user computes the discriminant of the quadratic equation and finds the roots. This step is important because it confirms there are two distinct real roots, ensuring two tangent lines exist. The roots a₁ and a₂ are expressed in terms of t and √(t² + 1), which are key for later calculations.

The user then moves on to finding the area S(t). They first consider the area of the triangle formed by the points (t, -1), (a₁, a₁²), and (a₂, a₂²). However, they later correct this approach by realizing S(t) is the integral of the difference between the parabola and the tangent lines between a₂ and a₁, split at x = t. This integral approach correctly computes S(t) as (2/3)(t² + 1)^(3/2). This formula is vital for subsequent steps, so marking where this is derived is crucial.

The next step is minimizing S(t)/√t. The user uses logarithmic differentiation to find the critical point at t = 1/√5. This calculus step is essential for determining the minimum value. The user verifies this critical point is a minimum using the first derivative test, which is important for confirming the solution's validity.

Finally, substituting t = 1/√5 back into the S(t)/√t expression yields the minimal value. The detailed calculation involving exponents and radicals to simplify the expression is necessary to reach the final answer. Ensuring these simplification steps are marked helps trace how the final answer is derived.

Throughout the process, key equations (like the quadratic formula, integral results, and differentiation steps) must be retained as they form the backbone of the solution. Errors in the initial approach (e.g., incorrect area calculation) are acknowledged and corrected, but the corrected parts are more critical for the final answer. Additionally, verifying results with specific cases (like t = 0) ensures the formulas are correct, but these checks might be omitted in the kept text if they don't directly contribute to the final formula.
