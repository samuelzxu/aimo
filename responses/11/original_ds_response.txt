Okay, so I have this problem here where a, b, c are complex numbers with product 1. None of them are real, and none have absolute value 1. They define p as (a + b + c) + (1/a + 1/b + 1/c), and q as a/b + b/c + c/a. Both p and q are real. I need to find all possible ordered pairs (p, q). Hmm, complex numbers with product 1. So abc = 1. None of them are real or on the unit circle, which is interesting. So they can’t be real, even if their modulus is not 1. So all of a, b, c are complex but non-real, with modulus different from 1, but their product is 1. 

First, let me note that since abc = 1, maybe we can write 1/a = bc, 1/b = ac, 1/c = ab. So 1/a + 1/b + 1/c = bc + ac + ab. So p can be written as (a + b + c) + (ab + bc + ca). So p = a + b + c + ab + bc + ca. That might be easier to work with. So p is equal to the sum of the variables plus the sum of their products two at a time. That form makes me think of the expansion of (1 + a)(1 + b)(1 + c), but that would also include the term abc, which is 1 here. Hmm, let me see: (1 + a)(1 + b)(1 + c) = 1 + (a + b + c) + (ab + bc + ca) + abc. Since abc = 1, that means (1 + a)(1 + b)(1 + c) = 1 + (a + b + c) + (ab + bc + ca) + 1 = (a + b + c) + (ab + bc + ca) + 2. Wait, so then p = (1 + a)(1 + b)(1 + c) - 2. Not sure if that helps immediately, but maybe.

Now, q is defined as a/b + b/c + c/a. So let's express q in terms of a, b, c. Since abc = 1, maybe substitutions could help here. For example, if abc = 1, then c = 1/(ab). Let me try that. Let's write c as 1/(ab). Then q becomes a/b + b/(1/(ab)) + (1/(ab))/a. Simplify each term: a/b is the same; b divided by 1/(ab) is b * ab = a b^2; and (1/(ab))/a is 1/(a^2 b). So q = a/b + a b^2 + 1/(a^2 b). Hmm, this seems more complicated. Maybe that substitution isn't helpful. Instead, perhaps keeping variables as they are and using symmetries or equations from p and q.

Given that both p and q are real numbers. So even though a, b, c are complex, p and q end up being real. So p is real, which is (a + b + c) + (ab + bc + ca), and q is a/b + b/c + c/a, which is also real. The conditions given are that a, b, c are non-real, not on the unit circle, product 1. Need to find possible ordered pairs (p, q).

Maybe using the fact that if a complex number is real, its complex conjugate is itself. So for p to be real, p = conjugate(p). Similarly for q. So let's try to write conjugate(p) = p.

Given that complex conjugate of a sum is sum of conjugates. Similarly, since ab = conjugate(ab) if and only if ab is real, but we know none of a, b, c are real, so probably ab isn't real either? Hmm, but their product abc is 1, which is real. Hmm, abc = 1, which is real. So the product of three complex numbers is real. That tells me something about the arguments. Let me denote in polar forms: Let’s suppose that a = r_a e^{iθ_a}, b = r_b e^{iθ_b}, c = r_c e^{iθ_c}, so that their product is r_a r_b r_c e^{i(θ_a + θ_b + θ_c)} = 1. Since 1 has modulus 1 and argument 0, so modulus r_a r_b r_c = 1, and arguments θ_a + θ_b + θ_c ≡ 0 mod 2π. So, θ_a + θ_b + θ_c = 2π k for some integer k. Hmm, as modulus: r_a r_b r_c = 1.

But the problem states none of a, b, c are real, and none have modulus 1. So none of r_a, r_b, r_c is 1, and none of θ_a, θ_b, θ_c is 0 or π. Hmm. Also, none of them are real, so their arguments are not 0 or π. 

But maybe writing in terms of reciprocals: Since abc = 1, 1/a = bc, 1/b = ac, 1/c = ab, as before. So 1/a is bc. Let me explore this. So p is a + b + c + bc + ac + ab. That's interesting because p can be written as a(1 + b + c) + (b + c) + bc. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, p is (a + 1/a) + (b + 1/b) + (c + 1/c). Wait, wait a second. Since 1/a = bc, and similarly for others. So a + 1/a = a + bc; similarly for the others. So that's where p came from, originally. So (a + bc) + (b + ac) + (c + ab) = (a + b + c) + (ab + bc + ca). So that's correct. So p = (a + b + c) + (ab + bc + ca).

So that's equivalent to (1 + a)(1 + b)(1 + c) - 2, as established earlier. But I don't see immediately how to use this.

Alternatively, maybe using Vieta’s formula. If we consider a polynomial equation whose roots are a, b, c. Then, since abc = 1, the constant term would be -1 (for cubic x^3 - sx^2 + tx - 1 = 0, where s = a + b + c, t = ab + bc + ca). Then p = s + t, which is s + t = p. So in the cubic equation, the coefficient of x^2 is -s, the coefficient of x is t, and the constant term is -1.

But given that a, b, c are complex numbers, non-real, but their product is 1, and the coefficients of the polynomial are related to their sums and products. But how does that help us with p and q?

Wait, if p = s + t is real, so the polynomial x^3 - s x^2 + t x - 1 has coefficients s, t, such that s + t is real. Hmm. But but the problem states that p is real. Similarly, q is a/b + b/c + c/a. Hmm. Maybe not directly applicable. 

Alternatively, q is a/b + b/c + c/a. Let me try to express q in terms of a, b, c. Since abc = 1, then q can be written in terms of a^2, b^2, c^2? Let's multiply numerator and denominator by appropriate terms. For example, a/b = a^2 c (since abc = 1 => c = 1/(ab)), so maybe:

q = a/b + b/c + c/a = a^2 c + b^2 a + c^2 b. Because:

a/b = a/(b) * (ac)/(ac) = a^2 c / (abc) = a^2 c /1 = a^2 c. Similarly, b/c = b/(c) * (ab)/(ab) = b^2 a / (abc) = b^2 a. Similarly, c/a = c/a * (bc)/(bc) = c^2 b / (abc) = c^2 b. Therefore, q = a^2 c + b^2 a + c^2 b. Hmm. So q = a^2 c + b^2 a + c^2 b. Since abc = 1, q = a^2 c + b^2 a + c^2 b = a^2 c + b^2 a + c^2 b, which might still be tricky.

But given that q is real. Maybe using the fact that if a complex number is equal to its conjugate, then it's real. So q = \overline{q}. Let's write that.

q = a^2 c + b^2 a + c^2 b

\overline{q} = \overline{a^2 c} + \overline{b^2 a} + \overline{c^2 b} = \overline{a}^2 \overline{c} + \overline{b}^2 \overline{a} + \overline{c}^2 \overline{b}

Since q is real, we have a^2 c + b^2 a + c^2 b = \overline{a}^2 \overline{c} + \overline{b}^2 \overline{a} + \overline{c}^2 \overline{b}

This seems too general, maybe difficult to use.

Wait, but given that abc = 1, so c = 1/(ab). Thus, \overline{c} = 1/(\overline{ab})). Therefore, maybe expressions can be written in terms of a and b only.

Alternatively, maybe take conjugate of variables. Let’s set x = \overline{a}, y = \overline{b}, z = \overline{c}. Since abc = 1, we have xyz = \overline{abc} = \overline{1} = 1. Thus, xyz = 1 as well.

But we need the condition that p is real. Let me also write that. Since p = a + b + c + ab + bc + ca is real, then its conjugate is equal to itself. Therefore:

\overline{p} = \overline{a + b + c + ab + bc + ca} = \overline{a} + \overline{b} + \overline{c} + \overline{ab} + \overline{bc} + \overline{ca} = x + y + z + xy + yz + zx = p

Similarly, p = x + y + z + xy + yz + zx

But xyz = 1. So similar to a, b, c. So the conjugate variables x, y, z also satisfy the same product condition, which might not be immediately helpful. But if I assume some symmetry.

Wait, given that a, b, c are inverses of the conjugate variables? Not sure. Maybe if |a| ≠ 1, but since abc = 1, if |a||b||c| = 1, so if |a|, |b|, |c| are all greater than 1 or less than 1. But problem states that none of them have absolute value 1. So either all three have | | >1, or all | | <1, or some mix. But their product is 1, so if two have modulus greater than 1 and one less, but their product is 1. Hmm, but not sure if this is helpful.

Alternatively, maybe assume that a, b, c are roots of some cubic equation with real coefficients? Because then their imaginary parts come in conjugate pairs. But the problem says that none are real, so they must form a trio of complex conjugates. However, a cubic with real coefficients must have either three real roots or one real and two complex conjugates. But the problem states none of a, b, c are real. So that suggests that they cannot be roots of a cubic with real coefficients. Therefore, perhaps we cannot assume that. Hmm, so perhaps that approach isn't helpful.

Wait, but both p and q are real. So even though a, b, c aren't real, some combinations of them are real. Perhaps we can use some relationships here. Let's think about using the fact that if z is a non-real complex number, then z + \overline{z} is real, and z \overline{z} is real (the modulus squared). Since p is a combination of a, b, c and their reciprocals (but since abc = 1, reciprocals can be expressed as products of other variables). 

Let me think of a different approach. Let me let a, b, c be three numbers such that abc = 1. Let's denote x = a, y = b, z = c. Then, given xyz = 1. Then, p = x + y + z + xy + yz + zx. And q = x/y + y/z + z/x. Let's consider that p and q are real. Maybe express everything in terms of two variables, since the product is 1.

Assume a = x, b = y, c = 1/(xy). Then, substitute into p and q:

p = x + y + 1/(xy) + xy + y/(xy) + x/(xy) = x + y + 1/(xy) + xy + 1/x + 1/y

Similarly, simplify: + xy + terms. Let me compute each term:

First, p = x + y + c (which is 1/(xy)) + ab (which is x*y) + bc (which is y*(1/(xy)) = 1/x ) + ca (which is (1/(xy)) * x = 1/y )

So yes, indeed:

p = x + y + 1/(xy) + xy + 1/x + 1/y

Similarly, q = x/y + y/(1/(xy)) + (1/(xy))/x = x/y + y*(xy) + 1/(x^2 y)

Calculating each term:

x/y remains as is.

y/(1/(xy)) = y * (xy) = x y^2

(1/(xy))/x = 1/(x^2 y )

Therefore, q = x/y + x y^2 + 1/(x^2 y )

But now this seems really complicated. Perhaps there's another substitution?

Alternatively, setting variables in terms of exponentials. Since modulus isn't 1, maybe log variables?

But let's assume for simplicity that all variables are real? Wait, but the problem states that none of a, b, c are real or have absolute value 1. So that approach is invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps take a, b, c to be complex numbers lying on some specific curves? Not sure.

Wait, another thought. Since abc = 1, take logarithms? If we let log a = A, log b = B, log c = C, then A + B + C = 2πik for some integer k. But since a, b, c are complex and not on the unit circle, their logs would have non-zero real parts. But I don't see how that helps here.

Alternatively, considering symmetric functions. Hmm, given that p and q are symmetric in a, b, c in some way. p is the sum of variables and their pairwise products. q is the cyclic sum of variables divided by each other. Hmm, but maybe not symmetric. Wait, q = a/b + b/c + c/a. It's rotationally symmetric, if we permute a→b→c→a. Similarly, p is symmetric in a, b, c. So perhaps we can relate p and q through symmetric expressions.

Alternatively, notice that q is related to some expression of p. For example, we can try expanding (a + b + c)*(1/a + 1/b + 1/c). Which is 3 + a/b + a/c + b/a + b/c + c/a + c/b. Wait, so (a + b + c)(1/a + 1/b + 1/c) = 3 + (a/b + b/a + a/c + c/a + b/c + c/b). So if p = (a + b + c) + (1/a + 1/b + 1/c) = s + t where s = a + b + c and t = 1/a + 1/b +1/c. Then the product s * t = 3 + sum of all possible ratios. However, the sum of all possible ratios includes q and other terms. Specifically, in q you have a/b + b/c + c/a, but the others would be reciprocals: b/a + c/b + a/c. Wait, so (s)(t) = 3 + q + (b/a + c/b + a/c). But b/a + c/b + a/c is the reciprocal of q? Wait, if we take reciprocal of each term in q: q = a/b + b/c + c/a. Reciprocal terms would be b/a + c/b + a/c. Let's denote this as q'. Then q' = b/a + c/b + a/c. So (s)(t) = 3 + q + q'.

Moreover, note that q and q' are related. For example, take q * q' = (a/b + b/c + c/a)(b/a + c/b + a/c). Let's compute this:

First term: a/b * b/a = 1

Second: a/b * c/b = (c)/(b^2)

Third: a/b * a/c = a^2/(b c)

Similarly, b/c * b/a = b^2/(a c)

Fourth: b/c * c/b = 1

Fifth: b/c * a/c = (a b)/c^2

c/a * b/a = (b c)/a^2

c/a * c/b = c^2/(a b)

Sixth: c/a * a/c = 1

So adding them up: 1 + 1 + 1 + [ (c)/(b^2) + a^2/(b c) + b^2/(a c) + (a b)/c^2 ) + (b c)/a^2 + c^2/(a b) ]

Hence, q * q' = 3 + [ (c/b^2 + a^2/(b c) + b^2/(a c) + (a b)/c^2 + (b c)/a^2 + c^2/(a b) ) ]

But this is very complicated, perhaps there's no immediate simplification. However, if I consider that abc = 1, we can make substitutions. Let's note that since abc = 1, any term can be expressed in terms of two variables. For example, let's write c = 1/(ab). Then:

Term1: c/b2 = 1/(a b) / b2 = 1/(a b^3)

Term2: a^2/(b c) = a^2/(b*(1/(a b))) ) = a^2/(b/(a b)) = a^2 * (a b)/b = a^3

Term3: b2/(a c) = b2 / (a * 1/(a b)) ) = b2 / (a/(a b)) ) = b2 * (a b)/a = b^3

Term4: (a b)/c2 = (a b)/(1/(a b))2 = (a b) * (a b)^2 = (a b)^3

Term5: (b c)/a2 = (b * 1/(a b)) / a2 = (1/a)/a2 = 1/a3

Term6: c2/(a b) = (1/(a b))2 / (a b) )= 1/(a^3 b^3 ) = 1/( (a b)^3 )

So replacing each term:

Term1: 1/(a b^3)

Term2: a^3

Term3: b^3

Term4: (a b)^3

Term5: 1/a3

Term6: 1/( a3 b3 )

But this seems like each term is a power of a and/or b, which may not help. Maybe some pattern here? If I let’s set a = t, then terms involve t and 1/t.

Alternatively, perhaps taking a, b, c as reciprocal pairs? But with product 1. Wait, but they're all not real or on unit circle, so difficult.

Alternatively, maybe we can assume that two variables are reciprocals. For example, let’s suppose a = 1/b, so that ab = 1, then c = 1/(ab) = 1. But c would then be 1, which is on the unit circle, which is prohibited. So that’s invalid. Similarly, if we set a=1/b, would lead to c=1, which is not allowed. So perhaps variables can't be reciprocals. Similarly, if variables are inverses up to some rotation. 

Hmm, this approach is getting too convoluted. Let me think of specific examples where p and q are real. 

Suppose that a, b, c are arranged such that they form a reciprocal triplet in some sense. Given that abc = 1, perhaps each is the reciprocal of another? But permutation? So like a = 1/b, b = 1/c, c = 1/a. But then abc = (1/b)(1/c)(1/a) = 1/(a b c ), which would only hold if abc = 1/(a b c ), implying (abc)^2 = 1, so abc = ±1. But in the problem, abc = 1, so such arrangement would imply abc = 1 so 1/(a b c ) =1, so possible. Then indeed, if a = 1/b, b = 1/c, c = 1/a. Then, it's a cyclic relationship. But let's test this.

Suppose that a = 1/b, b = 1/c, c = 1/a. Then, substituting, a = 1/b, so c = 1/a = b, and then b = 1/c = 1/b. Hence, b = 1/b => b^2 =1, so b=±1. But problem states that none of a, b, c are real, which forbids this. Hence, such a case is impossible.

Another approach: Since a,b,c are complex numbers whose product is 1, perhaps taking a = k, b = k, c =1/k^2. Then check if p and q can be real. But then c =1/k2. Then, product is a*b*c =k*k*(1/k2) = 1. Also, none of them are real, modulus not 1. Let k be a complex number with modulus not 1, e.g., k = 2i (modulus 2), then c =1/( (2i)^2 ) = 1/(-4) = -1/4. But c = -1/4 is real, which is prohibited. Not allowed. So, this case is invalid. Alternatively, maybe non-real c as well.

Alternatively, take a = re^{iθ}, b = re^{iθ}, c=1/(r2 e^{i2θ}). So a = b = re^{iθ}, c =1/(r2 e^{i2θ}). Product a*b*c = r2 e^{i2θ} * c = r2 e^{i2θ} *1/(r2 e^{i2θ}) = 1. So product is 1. But a and b have modulus r ≠1, c has modulus 1/(r2). Also, none are real if θ ≠0, π. Then compute p and q:

p = a + b + c + ab + bc + ca = 2 re^{iθ} + 1/(r2 e^{i2θ}) + (r e^{iθ})2 + (r e^{iθ})(1/(r2 e^{i2θ})) + (1/(r2 e^{i2θ}))(re^{iθ})

Let me compute step by step:

- a + b = 2r e^{iθ}
- c = 1/(r2 e^{i2θ})
- ab = (r e^{iθ})2 = r2 e^{i2θ}
- bc = (r e^{iθ})*(1/(r2 e^{i2θ})) = (1/r) e^{-iθ}
- ca = (1/(r2 e^{i2θ}))*(r e^{iθ}) = (1/r) e^{-iθ}

Thus, p = 2r e^{iθ} + 1/(r2 e^{i2θ}) + r2 e^{i2θ} + (1/r e^{-iθ}) + (1/r e^{-iθ})

Simplify:

= 2r e^{iθ} + [r2 e^{i2θ} + 1/(r2 e^{i2θ}) ] + 2/(r) e^{-iθ}

But expressions like r2 e^{i2θ} + 1/(r2 e^{i2θ}) would be similar to 2x cosφ if 2θ etc., but may not be real unless their imaginary parts cancel. Wait, but for p to be real. Let's set expressions to be real.

So first, a and b are conjugates. Maybe making a the conjugate of b. But given the problem states none are real. Let's try another approach.

Let’s suppose that a, b, c are such that a = \overline{b}, c is real? But then c must not be real, violating the condition. But c is not real. So no.

Alternatively, suppose that c = \overline{d}, where d is some variable. But likely overcomplicating.

Alternatively, assume a = d, b = d, c =1/d2 as before, but complex d. For instance, let d be a complex number not on the unit circle and non-real. Let d = re^{iθ}, then c =1/(d2). Then compute p and q.

But earlier attempted similar:

So proceed with calculating p:

p = 2d + 1/d2 + d2 + 2/d e^{-iθ}

But with d = re^{iθ}, substitutions.

Alternatively, make this concrete. Let’s pick specific values. Wait, the problem says that a, b, c can't be on unit circle, modulus not 1, nor can they be real. Let me choose a such that |a| = 2, arg(a) = θ, b = a (so same modulus and argument), c =1/a2. Then compute p and q. Test if p and q are real.

Compute p = a + a + 1/a2 + a2 + a*(1/a2) + (1/a2)*a. So:

= 2a + 1/a2 + a2 + 1/a + 1/a. 

= 2a + a2 + 1/a2 + 2/a.

Now, set a = 2 e^{iθ}, so 1/a = 1/(2 e^{iθ}) = (1/2) e^{-iθ}, and 1/a2 = (1/4) e^{-i2θ}.

Thus, p = 2*(2 e^{iθ}) + (4 e^{i2θ}) + (1/4 e^{-i2θ}) + 2*(1/2) e^{-iθ}

Simplify:

= 4 e^{iθ} + 4 e^{i2θ} + (1/4) e^{-i2θ} + e^{-iθ}

This need to be real. For p to be real, it must equal its conjugate. Let’s compute conjugate(p):

Conj(p) = 4 e^{-iθ} + 4 e^{-i2θ} + (1/4) e^{i2θ} + e^{iθ}

Set p = conj(p):

4 e^{iθ} + 4 e^{i2θ} + (1/4) e^{-i2θ} + e^{-iθ} = 4 e^{-iθ} + 4 e^{-i2θ} + (1/4) e^{i2θ} + e^{iθ}

Rearranging terms:

Left side: 4 e^{iθ} + 4 e^{i2θ} + (1/4) e^{-i2θ} + e^{-iθ}

Right side: 4 e^{-iθ} + 4 e^{-i2θ} + (1/4) e^{i2θ} + e^{iθ}

Subtracting right side from left side:

(4 e^{iθ} - e^{iθ}) + (4 e^{i2θ} - (1/4) e^{i2θ}) + ( (1/4) e^{-i2θ} - 4 e^{-i2θ}) + (e^{-iθ} -4 e^{-iθ}) = 0

Simplify:

3 e^{iθ} + (15/4) e^{i2θ} - (15/4) e^{-i2θ} - 3 e^{-iθ} = 0

Which can be expressed in terms of sine and cosine:

3(e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ}) + (15/4)(e^{i2θ} - e^{-i2θ}) = 0

That's:

3*(2i sinθ) + (15/4)*(2i sin2θ) = 0

Divide by 2i:

3 sinθ + (15/4) sin2θ = 0

Express sin2θ as 2 sintheta cos theta:

3 sinθ + (15/4)*2 sinθ cosθ = 0

Simplify:

3 sinθ + (15/2) sinθ cosθ = 0

Factor out sinθ:

sinθ [3 + (15/2) cosθ] = 0

Solutions: sinθ =0 → θ=0, π, which would make a real (since a= 2e^{iθ}), which is prohibited.

OR

3 + (15/2) cosθ =0 → cosθ= - (3)*(2/15) = -2/5

Therefore, cosθ = -2/5, which would allow theta = arccos(-2/5). So θ is not 0 or pi. Then this gives us a valid angle.

So if I take θ = arccos(-2/5), then p is real. So p would be a real number in this setup. Similarly, check if q is real. Compute q = a/b + b/c + c/a. But a = b here, so a/b =1, similarly, b/c = a / (1/a2) = a^3, and c/a =1/(a^3)

So q =1 + a^3 + 1/a^3

Since a^3 is (2 e^{iθ})^3 =8 e^{i3θ}, 1/a^3 =1/(8 e^{i3θ})= (1/8)e^{-i3θ}

So q =1 +8 e^{i3θ} + (1/8) e^{-i3θ}

Which is 1 +8 e^{i3θ} + (1/8) e^{-i3θ}

Let’s compute that expression:

Expressed in terms of cos(3θ) and sin(3θ).

It would be 1 +8(cos3θ + i sin3θ) + (1/8)(cos3θ - i sin3θ )

Simplify real and imaginary parts:

Real: 1 +8cos3θ + (1/8)cos3θ =1 + (8 + 1/8)cos3θ =1 + (65/8)cos3θ

Imaginary:8 sin3θ - (1/8) sin3θ = (63/8) sin3θ

For q to be real, the imaginary part must equal zero. Hence:

(63/8) sin3θ =0 → sin3θ =0. Therefore, 3θ = nπ, n∈Z

Thus, θ = nπ/3.

But earlier, from the p condition, θ must satisfy cosθ=-2/5. However, θ = nπ/3.

So if we check: for θ= arccos(-2/5), which does not in general equal nπ/3. So sin3θ is not zero. Therefore, in this example, even though p is real, q is not real, which violates the problem conditions. Hence, such a choice of a=b, c=1/a2 does not lead to both p and q being real.

Hence, maybe such a case is impossible, so perhaps we need a different approach.

Alternative approach: Let's suppose that the numbers a, b, c lie on a circle in the complex plane, but modulus not 1. But since their product is 1, they can’t all be outside or inside the unit circle. For instance, two are outside and one inside.

Alternatively, since abc=1, maybe taking them as a, b, c such that one is the product of the other two. But maybe no.

Another thought: If both p and q are real, maybe it's necessary that certain symmetries exist. For example, suppose that the set {a, b, c} is closed under complex conjugation. But with three elements, none of which are real, the only way to be closed under conjugation is that they come in conjugate pairs and one more. But there are three, so that would mean one is real. But problem states none are real. Hence, that's impossible. Hence, these numbers cannot be closed under conjugation. So each has a distinct conjugate not among them.

But then, the only way combinations of them can be real is if their expressions in p and q are a result of symmetric arrangements.

Alternatively, since abc =1, perhaps consider that one of the variables is the product of conjugates of the others. For instance, maybe c = \overline{a b}. Given that abc=1, c=1/(ab). Therefore, 1/(ab)= \overline{a b}. Therefore, \overline{a b} = 1/(ab). So

\overline{a b} = \frac{1}{a b} → |a b|^2 =1 → |a|^2 |b|^2 =1 → |a||b|=1. But problem states that none of them have modulus 1. Hence, |a| and |b| are reciprocal. But then |c| = |1/(ab)| =1/( |a||b| ) =1/( (1/|b| ) |b| )=1 , which is prohibited since |c|=1 is disallowed. Thus, this also fails.

Another approach: Set variables with relationships such that expressions p and q collapse. For example, let’s let a, b, c satisfy some equations such that p and q are real.

Suppose a = A, b = B, c =1/(AB), realness conditions p and q are real. But need to ensure a, b, c are not real.

Alternatively, work with variables s = a + b + c, t = ab + bc + ca, which is p =s + t.

Given s and t are connected through abc =1. Then perhaps find relations between s and t when some expressions are real.

But we have a cubic equation x3 -s x2 + t x -1 =0. Since a, b, c are roots, but not real, so the cubic must have three non-real roots. Then the cubic must have a discriminant leading to such. For a cubic with real coefficients, having three non-real roots is impossible. Because complex roots come in pairs. Hence, thus our cubic must have non-real coefficients, making it hard to apply that.

Alternatively, think of log variables? If abc =1, set variables w = ln a, z = ln b, v = ln c, but they are also complex. Not helpful.

Another Idea: For q to be real, q must equal its conjugate. q = a/b + b/c + c/a.

Taking conjugate(q) = \overline{a}/\overline{b} + \overline{b}/\overline{c} + \overline{c}/\overline{a}

Since abc =1, and similarly \overline{a} \overline{b} \overline{c} = \overline{1} =1.

So define x = \overline{a}, y = \overline{b}, z = \overline{c}, which satisfies xyz=1. Therefore, conjugate(q) = x/y + y/z + z/x. So if we can relate q to expressions in terms of x, y, z, but it's essentially the same expression as q with a, b, c replaced by their conjugates. Hmmm. To have q real, need x/y + y/z + z/x = a/b + b/c +c /a. Which is, probably tough to exploit unless there's some symmetry.

But maybe for this to hold, require that a/b = conjugate of y/z, since z is conjugate of c. Hmmm, perhaps requiring relationships like a/b = conjugate(b/c), ie, a/b = \overline{(b/c) }, then a/c = |b|^2. But not sure.

Similarly, set each term in q equal to the conjugate of another term:

Suppose a/b = \overline{(b/c)}, so a/b = \overline{b}/\overline{c} = \overline{b}/(1/(\overline{a}\overline{b})) ) = \overline{b} * \overline{a}\overline{b} )= |b|^2 \overline{a}

Thus, a/b = |b|^2 \overline{a} →Multiply both sides by b: a = |b|^2 \overline{a} b → Let’s write a in terms of conjugate:

If we take conjugate of both sides: \overline{a} = |b|2 a \overline{b} → Then original equation: a = |b|^2 \overline{a} b. Let me compose that:

From conjugate equation: \overline{a} = |b|^2 a \overline{b}

Multiply both sides by b:

\overline{a} b = |b|^2 a \overline{b} b = |b|^2 a |b|^2 = |b|^4 a

Thus, using this in original equation: a = |b|^2 \overline{a} b = |b|^2*(|b|^4 a ) ) = |b|^6 a → Therefore, |b|^6 =1 → |b|=1, which is prohibited. Thus, this approach is invalid.

Okay, this is getting too tangled. Let's maybe check if the only possible values are p= -1 and q=3. But no, that seems arbitrary.

Wait, let me test with a specific example where both p and q are real. Let's see if such examples exist.

Example 1:

Let’s take a, b, c such that a = e^{iθ}, b = e^{iθ}, c= e^{-i2θ}. But modulus of a and b is 1, which is prohibited. Thus invalid.

Example 2:

Let’s take a, b, c such that their arguments sum to zero. Let’s pick a = r e^{iθ}, b = r e^{-iθ}, c = 1/(r2 ). Then abc =1. So compute p and q.

Then a + b + c = r e^{iθ} + r e^{-iθ} + 1/r2 = 2r cosθ + 1/r2

ab + bc + ca = (r e^{iθ})(r e^{-iθ}) + (r e^{-iθ})(1/r2 ) + (1/r2)( r e^{iθ}) ) = r2 + (1/r) e^{-iθ} + (1/r ) e^{iθ} = r2 + (2/r) cosθ

Hence, p = [2r cosθ +1/r2] + [ r2 + 2/r cosθ ]= 2r cosθ +1/r2 + r2 + 2/r cosθ = r2 +1/r2+ 2 cosθ(r +1/r )

Similarly, q= a/b + b/c + c/a.

Compute each term:

a/b = (r e^{iθ})/( r e^{-iθ} )) = e^{i2θ}

b/c = (r e^{-iθ})/(1/r2 ) = r3 e^{-iθ}

c/a = (1/r2)/(r e^{iθ}) ) =1/(r3 e^{iθ})

Therefore, q= e^{i2θ} + r3 e^{-iθ} +1/( r3 e^{iθ})

To compute q being real:

Set complex expression q equal to its conjugate:

Conj(q) = e^{-i2θ} + r3 e^{iθ} +1/( r3 e^{-iθ})

Set q = Conj(q):

e^{i2θ} + r3 e^{-iθ} +1/( r3 e^{iθ} ) = e^{-i2θ} + r3 e^{iθ} +1/( r3 e^{-iθ} )

Hence:

e^{i2θ} - e^{-i2θ} + r3 ( e^{-iθ} - e^{iθ} ) + (1/( r3 e^{iθ} ) -1/( r3 e^{-iθ} )) =0

Factor terms:

[ e^{i2θ} - e^{-i2θ} ] + r3 [ e^{-iθ} - e^{iθ} ] + (1/r3)[ e^{-iθ} -e^{iθ} ] =0

Using Euler’s formula, e^{iΦ} - e^{-iΦ} = 2i sinΦ, the equation becomes:

2i sin2θ - r3 (2i sinθ) - (1/r3)(2i sinθ) =0

Factor out 2i sinθ:

2i sinθ [ sinθ / sinθ - r3 -1/r3 ] =0

Wait, let's parse:

E.g.: 2i sin2θ = 2i*2 sinθ cosθ =4i sinθ cosθ

So, rewrite the equality:

4i sinθ cosθ -2i sinθ ( r3 +1/r3 )=0

Factor out 2i sinθ:

2i sinθ[ 2 cosθ - ( r3 +1/r3 ) ] =0

Therefore, solutions are either sinθ=0 or 2 cosθ - ( r3 +1/r3 ) =0

Since a,b are not real, θ ≠ 0 or π, so sinθ ≠0. Hence, 2 cosθ = r3 +1/r3.

In addition, earlier p is given by p= r2 +1/r2 + 2 cosθ ( r +1/r ). Substitute 2 cosθ= r3 +1/r3:

Thus,

p= r2 +1/r2 + ( r3 +1/r3 )( r +1/r )

Expand the term:

r3*r +r3*1/r +1/r3*r +1/r3*1/r

= r^4 + r2 +r^{-2} + r^{-4}

Hence,

p= r2 +1/r2 + [ r^4 + r2 +1/r2 +1/r^4 ]

Therefore, p= r^4 +2r2 + 2/r2 +1/r^4

But we can also consider the equation 2 cosθ = r3 +1/r3.

Note that if R = r3 +1/r3, then cosθ = R /2.

But also, since -1 ≤ cosθ ≤1, we have -2 ≤ R ≤2. But since r is a positive real number ( modulus ), r ≠1. Also, modulus is related. If r>1, then r3 +1/r3 >2 ( as AM ≥ GM, minimum at r=1 which is 2 ), similarly if r <1, r3 +1/r3 >2. Wait, Wait, let's check the function f(r) =r3 +1/r3.

If r >1, then f(r) = r3 +1/r3. As r increases, r3 becomes large, so function tends to infinity. The minimum of f(r) occurs at r=1: which is 2. Similarly, if r <1, making s=1/r >1, f(r) = f(1/s)= s^{-3} + s^3, also has minimum 2 at s=1. So in reality, r3 +1/r3 ≥2, with equality only if r=1, which is prohibited. Hence, r3 +1/r3 ≥2, which would mean cosθ ≥1, but since maximum of cosine is 1, equality required when cosθ=1, meaning θ=0. But theta=0 implies a and b are real, which is prohibited. Therefore, there are no solutions except for theta=0 and r=1, both prohibited. Hence, no such example can satisfy these conditions, meaning this approach is dead end.

This is perplexing. So using symmetric approach where a and b are conjugates and c=1/(ab) didn't work. Trying a specific example seems not possible as it resulted in prohibited things. Hmmm.

Wait, another thought. Since none of a, b, c are real or modulus 1. Let’s consider them with moduli reciprocal-related. Like |a|=k>1, |b|=k>1, then |c|=1/k2 <1. So none have modulus 1, which is okay. Then, set arguments such that theta_a + theta_b + theta_c ≡0 mod 2π. Forcing abc=1.

However, suppose arranging a =k e^{iθ}, b=k e^{-iθ}, thus, ab =k2. Then c=1/(ab)=1/k2.

Therefore, arguments: theta_a=θ, theta_b=-θ, theta_c is? There's no restriction except that sum theta_a + theta_b + theta_c ≡0 mod2π.

Therefore, theta_c= -theta_a -theta_b = -θ +θ=0 → theta_c=0 +2πn. But theta_c=0 would imply c is real. Which is prohibited. Therefore, contradiction. Hence, need different argument arrangements.

Alternatively, theta_c= pi. But c=1/k2 e^{i pi}, which is real. Still prohibited. Therefore, this approach may not work. So if arranging a= k e^{iθ}, b=k e^{-iθ}, c=1/k2 e^{i phi }, then theta_a + theta_b + theta_c =0 --> θ -θ + phi=0 --> phi=0, leading to real c. Which is prohibited. Hence, unless phi=pi, but that still real c. No good.

Therefore, perhaps the only way is to not have a and b conjugates. Alternatively, suppose three complex numbers with arguments θ, θ, -2θ, such that their sum is zero modulo 2pi. θ + theta -2θ=0. So anyway, perhaps leading to real numbers.

Alternatively, let me think that if theta sum to zero, but in a non symmetric way.

Alternately, consider all three variables with the same modulus, say r, but different arguments. Then since product is 1 modulus r^3 =1, so r=1, which is prohibited. So no. Hence, all three variables cannot have the same modulus.

Alternatively, two variables with reciprocal modulus and one with modulus not 1.

But overall, it's tough to arrange arguments such that p and q are real. Maybe considering algebra instead of analysis. Suppose we note that given p and q are real, can we relate p and q?

Alternatively, consider the expressions for p and q and cube roots of unity. Suppose a, b, c are roots of x^3 -1=0, but they are 1 and the complex roots. But those have modulus 1. Not allowed. Or if variables are scaled.

Alternatively, taking a complex number ω, non-real, not on unit circle such that ω^3=1. But also  prohibited if it's a root of x^3 -1. Since |ω|=1. Hence, no.

 Alternatively, if a = ω k, b=ω^2 k, c=1/(k^2 ω^3 ). If ω^3 =1. Then abc= ω k * ω2 k *1/(k2 ω3 )= ω^3 *(k^2/k2) *(1/ ω^3 )=1*1*1=1. Hence, such setup. Then p = a + b + c + ab + bc + ca. But setting:

a=omega k, b= omega2 k, c=1/(omega3k2 )=1/k2, sinceomega3=1. But hence c is real. Not allowed. Alternatively, choosing omega such that omega3 is not 1, but product fixed.

Not sure. Another approach, start by assuming that p and q take minimal values, or algebraic manipulation.

From p = a + b + c + ab + bc + ca = (a +1)(b +1)(c +1) - (abc +1) = (a+1)(b+1)(c+1) -2. But abc=1. Therefore, since the product (a+1)(b+1)(c+1) might be complex or real, but p is real, then (a+1)(b+1)(c+1) is real + 2. Hmmm.

But unless the product (a+1)(b+1)(c+1) has an imaginary part of zero. So imaginary part of (a+1)(b+1)(c+1) is zero, but I can'ts see why. Unless constraints on a, b, c cause this.

Alternatively, maybe multiply q by some term and combine with p. For example, if q = a/b + b/c + c/a. Let me multiply both sides by a b c. Since a bc =1, so ab*c =a. So a b c =1. Hence, multiplying q by a b c=q*1, we get q = a/b + b/c +c/a = (a^2 c + b^2 a +c^2 b)/(abc)= a^2 c + b^2 a +c^2 b, since abc=1. So q is equal to a2 c + b2 a +c2 b. Alternatively, similar terms. But don't see the link with p.

Wait, what if I square p? p = a + b + c +ab+ bc+ ca. compute p2. Maybe that expands to something that can be combined with q, but seems messy.

Alternatively, writing in terms of reciprocals. Since c =1/(ab), perhaps writing p in terms of a and b.

 p= a + b +1/(ab) +ab + a/(ab) +b/(ab) = a + b +1/ab + ab +1/b +1/a. Similarly, p = a + 1/a + b +1/b +1/(ab) + ab. Interesting, structuring this, maybe group terms.

Similarly, q =a/b + b/(1/(ab)) + (1/(ab))/a = a/b + ab2 +1/(a2 b ). So earlier same expression.

Is there any relationship between these terms? Or maybe let variables be x and y like with x = a +1/a and y= b +1/b, and maybe z= ab +1/(ab).

But since c=1/(ab), we can have z= ab +c.

Then p =x + y + z.

But not sure. Let me set x =a +1/a, y =b +1/b. Then, ab +1/(ab) is some other variable, w. Then p= x + y + w. However need to relate them. Additionally, q would involve terms like a/b +ab2 +1/(a2 b ). But not sure.

Alternatively, express terms in terms of x =a +1/a , similarly y = b +1/b.

Since a and b are complex numbers, x and y are of the form z +1/z, which for complex z is a kind of cosθ analog if z is on the unit circle, but here a and b are not.

Alternatively, notice that x = a +1/a = (a^2 +1)/a. That quadratic expression. However, if a is a root of a quadratic equation. Maybe consider minimal polynomials.

But overall, this is not straightforward. Perhaps need to assume that p and q take specific values. For instance, if all variables satisfy a =1/w -1, but not sure.

Alternatively, assume that a, b, c satisfy a =1/(1 -x), but not obviously helpful.

Wait, let's step back and revisit the key information given. All relevant variables are non-real, non-unital modulus, abc =1, and two expressions, p and q, which are real.

And the problem is from David Altizio, which suggests there is a clever solution instead of heavy computation.

Recall that from abc =1, we can perhaps normalize variables, such that leaving to substitute variables. For example, let me set b = a * z, c = 1/(a*b ) =1/(a^2 z). Hence, c =1/(a^2 z )

Then, substitute into p:

p =a + b + c +ab + bc + ca

Plugging b and c:

= a + a z + 1/(a2 z ) + a*(a z ) + (a z )*1/(a2 z ) +1/(a2 z )* a

Simplify term by term:

- a
- a z
- 1/(a2 z )
- a2 z
- (a z)/(a2 z ) =1/a
- 1/(a z )

Hence,

p = a + a z +1/(a2 z ) +a2 z +1/a +1/(a z )

Grouping terms:

= [a +1/a ] + [ a z +1/(a z ) ] + [a2 z + 1/(a2 z ) ]

Each bracket is of the form t +1/t.

Thus, denote t1 =a, t2= a z, t3 =a2 z. But not sure if that helps.

But since each pair is reciprocal? For example, setting t1 =a, then [a +1/a ]=t1 +1/t1. Similarly, for t2= a z, so [a z +1/(a z )]=t2 +1/t2. Similarly for t3 =a2 z, but need to see relationship between t1, t2, t3.

T1 = a.

T2 = a z = T1 * z.

T3 =a2 z =T12 z= T1* (T1 z )=T1 *T2.

Is there a relationship? Hmmm.

Moreover, since abc =1, a * a z *1/(a2 z )=1, which holds.

Regardless, the significance of expressing each bracket as t +1/t is that each of these terms would be real if t is real. But since a is complex and non-real, t1 is non-real, so t +1/t is an expression. However, for each of these brackets to be real, require that t +1/t is real, which for complex t would imply that t lies on the unit circle oris real. But since a is neither real nor of modulus 1, this is not the case.

Wait, here's an important point: If we have complex t, then t +1/t is real if and only if t is real (with t≠0) or |t|=1 . Because:

Let’s prove that t +1/t is real ⇛ either t is real or |t|=1.

Let t =x +iy, then 1/t = (x - iy)/(x2 + y2).

Hence, t +1/t =x +iy + (x -iy)/(x2 + y2 ).

Thus, for t +1/t to be real:

Imaginary part: y - y/(x2 + y2 )=0 → y [1 -1/(x2 + y2 ) ]=0.

Thus, y=0 or x2 + y2=1. So y=0 (t is real) or |t|=1.

Since in our problem a is neither real nor on unit circle, none in t1, t2, t3 are real or unimodular. Hence, each bracket [a +1/a], [a z +1/(a z ),], [a2 z +1/(a2 z )] cannot be real, but their sum p is real. Hence, their imaginary parts must cancel each other out.

Similarly, for q, which is a/b +b/c +c/a =1/z + z *a2 z + 1/(a2 z )/a.

Wait, q= a/b + b/c +c/a = a/(a z ) + (a z )/(1/(a2 z )) + (1/(a2 z )) /a.= 1/z + (a z )*a2 z +1/(a3 z )

=1/z +a^3 z2 +1/(a3 z ). 

Hmm, complicated term.

But suppose we define u = a3. Then a= u^(1/3). But then complex cube roots complicates.

Maybe look for substitution where terms repeat. For example, assume that a z = v, which has been defined earlier as t2.

In上述 p: p= t1 +1/t1 + t2 +1/t2 + t1 t2 +1/(t1 t2 ). Thus, p= (t1 +1/t1 ) + (t2 +1/t2 ) + (t1 t2 +1/(t1 t2 )).

Which is similar to the continued product or linked terms. It may have some symmetry properties.

Suppose t1 and t2 satisfy t2 =1/t1. Then t1 t2=1, so p= (t1 +1/t1 ) + (1/t1 +t1 ) + (1 +1)= 2(t1 +1/t1 ) +2.

But p would be real if t1 + 1/t1 is real, however t1 = a, and a is non-real, non-unimodular, so t1 + 1/t1 is complex. Hence, contradiction.

So this case is invalid.

Alternatively, suppose that t1 is related to t2 multiplicative inverses. For example, t2= conjugate(1/t1 ). So that for non-real t1, their inverse conjugates sum is real. Not sure.

Given the problem constraints and difficulty, perhaps the only possible ordered pairs are (p,q)=(-1,3). But where does this come from?

Wait, suppose a, b, c are roots of a cubic equation, such that p = s + t, q comes from another symmetrie. If the polynomial was like x^3 + px^2 + qx + r =0... But not exactly.

Alternatively, taking reciprocal vectors.

Alternatively, this can't take too long, given that it's an Olympiad problem.

Let’s see that the problem says none of a,b,c are real or have modulus 1, with product 1. So we need to use their reciprocal relationships.

Another Idea: Let’s take reciprocal:

Given abc=1, then taking reciprocals, (1/a)(1/b)(1/c)=1. Hence, in this problem, reciprocal triplet also lives in the same setup.

But 1/a is not possible in problem's condition, because if a isn't on unit circle, then 1/a is not on unit circle either.

Additionally, (denote S = a + b + c, T = ab + bc + ca. Then P = S + T. )

Given that abc=1, Then inverse variables satisfy a certain relation.

Assume that a、b、c are reciprocal to conjugates: like 1/a= \overline{b} etc. But modulo abc=1.

Alternatively, take a = \overline{1/b}, then ab = \overline{1}. That would imply c=1/(ab)=\overline{1}, but c is real. No good.

Alternatively, take a = \overline{1/b}, leading to modulus |a| =1/|b | ; then c =1/(ab)=1/(\overline{1/b }*b )=1/( |b |2 )

Which is real if |b |^2 real, i.e., real positive. However c=1/(|b |2 ) is positive real. which is prohibited. So again invalid.

Thus such setup leads to real c, which is prohibited.

Given the failure of multiple approaches, perhaps the conclusion is that the only values are (p, q)=(-1,3).

Let me test in this case. If p=-1, then (1 +s +t +u) - 2 = (1 + p) -2 =

Wait earlier p= (1 +a)(1 +b)(1 +c) - 2. So if p=-1, then (1 +a)(1 +b)(1 +c)=1. Hence, (1 +a)(1 +b)(1 +c)=1. Expand this:

1 + (a +b +c) + (ab + bc + ca) + abc=1. But abc=1, so left side is 2 + (a +b +c) + (ab + bc + ca)= (a +b +c) + (ab + bc + ca ) +2.

So p= s + t where s= a +b +c, t=ab + bc + ca. If (1 +a)(1 +b)(1 +c)=1 + p +2 = 3 + p. If p=-1, then(1 +a)(1 +b)(1 +c)=2.

But any way, not directly leading.

Wait, another way: Suppose that (1 +a)(1 +b)(1 +c)=0. Then p= -2. But maybe this is invalid.

Given previous problem maybe David Altizio often uses cubic equations. So maybe let’s consider a = ω, cube roots of unity. But they have modulus 1. Not allowed. Problem explicitly says modulus not 1. So discard.

Perhaps substitute three numbers as solutions to equations like x^3 -qx^2 + px -1=0, where p and q are real coefficients and equations. But without real roots. But from Descarte’s signs, if the polynomial with real coefficients has three non-real roots, but coefficients real? which requires a pair of complexconjugate roots and third root which is real, conflict with requirement. So how dodge this?

But question restricts that a, b, c are non-real, then such a polynomial must have non-real coefficients. Hence, perhaps looking for cases where p and q have specific relationships leading to real pair.

Alternatively, combining p and q into a system of equations. For example, ifq is something like s^2 - 2t or similar.

But in our cubic, s= a +b +c, t=ab + bc + ca, but here p =s +t. Hmm. The cubic equation would be x^3 -s x^2 + t x-1 =0, with real coefficients only if s and t are real, but in the problem, s and t are combinations leading top and t real. Confusing?

Wait but problem says that a,b,c are complex non-real numbers with product 1, and p and q are real. If we form a cubic equation x3 -sx2 + tx -1=0 which has roots a,b,c. Even if roots are non-real and not conjugates, since s and t would need to be real by conjugation if the polynomial has real coefficients. But for cubic polynomial with three non-real roots, must have one real root. Hence our cubic polynomial must have non-real coefficients.

However, in our case, though p and q are real. But given that coefficients s and t are sums like a +b +c, ab + bc +ca. So coefficients would need to be real if complex roots come in Conjugate pairs, but as in the problem there are no real root s, hence no, such cubic cannot have real coefficients. Hence coefficients may be complex. Wait, but the problem states that p and q are real. Hence,p =s +t and q are real.

Thus s +t is real, and q is real, but individual components may not be real. This is allowable.

So in this case, coefficients s (sum a +b +c) and t (sum ab + bc + ca) may be complex, but their sum is real. Furthermore, individual coefficients may be complex but p is real. Not sure.

Even this direction is not leading anywhere. Finally, think of the answer. Since in olympiad problems like this sometimes uses (p, q)= (-1, 3). Maybe try this.

Suppose let’s think when p = -1 and q=3.

If p =-1 and q=3.

Take a test case where p and q equal to this. Suppose that a +b+ c +ab + bc + ca =-1 and a/b +b/c+ c/a=3. I need to check if possible.

Alternatively, use variables in logs.

But perhaps this is pointless. Since at this point, given the time I've invested trying, it could be (p, q)= (-1,3). But how confirm?

Alternatively, recall the problem states that none have modulus 1. If we let’s take a, b, c approaches 1, but with parameters so their product is 1 and both p and q are real. How would p and q behave.

But likely the desired answer is (-1,3), possibly the only possible pair.

Thus, after all this deduction my best guess is (p, q)=(-1,3). Hence, ordered pair is \boxed{(-1, 3)}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{(-1, 3)}
