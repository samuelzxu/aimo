Okay, I need to determine which parts of the provided reasoning are essential for future steps. Let's go through the thought process step by step.

First, the problem involves complex numbers a, b, c with product 1, none real or on the unit circle. The goal is to find real p and q defined as p = (a + b + c) + (1/a + 1/b + 1/c) and q = a/b + b/c + c/a.

Key steps include:
1. Recognizing abc = 1 allows substitutions like 1/a = bc.
2. Rewriting p as (a + b + c) + (ab + bc + ca), connecting it to the expansion of (1 + a)(1 + b)(1 + c).
3. Considering conjugates and modulus conditions for p and q to be real.
4. Exploring various substitutions and polynomial relationships, eventually leading to the conclusion that the only possible values are (p, q) = (-1, 3).

Essential tokens are those that establish definitions, substitutions, critical relationships (like abc = 1), and pivotal deductions leading to the final answer. Notably, the transformation of p using Vieta's formula, exploration of reciprocal relationships, and symmetry arguments are crucial. The final conclusion that p = -1 and q = 3 hinges on recognizing these transformations and constraints.

Now, marking the essential sections:
