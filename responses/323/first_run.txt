Alright, let me try to figure out which tokens are essential for the reasoning steps. The problem involves an equiangular hexagon with given side lengths and requires finding the square of the diameter of the largest circle that fits inside. The key steps were:

1. **Determining missing sides EF and FA**: By modeling the hexagon using complex numbers and solving the system of equations derived from the closed polygon condition.
2. **Calculating distances between opposite sides**: Identifying pairs of opposite sides (AB-DE, BC-EF, CD-FA) and computing their distances using line equations and the formula for distance between parallel lines.
3. **Selecting the minimal distance**: Choosing the smallest distance (7√3) between CD and FA as the diameter, then squaring it for the final answer.

Essential tokens include the complex plane modeling steps leading to solving for x and y (EF=2, FA=16), equations for real and imaginary parts, distances between opposite sides (especially CD-FA's distance calculation), and the conclusion of d²=147. These steps are critical as they lead directly to the solution and form the logical backbone of the reasoning process.
