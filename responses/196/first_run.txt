Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem step by step. The goal is to find EG² and then compute p + q + r where EG² = p - q√r. Here's how I'm approaching it:

First, I need to assign coordinates to the vertices to model the polyhedron in 3D. I'll place the square ABCD on the xy-plane with A at (0,0,0), B at (12,0,0), C at (12,12,0), and D at (0,12,0). 

Next, the trapezoid ABFG. Since AB is parallel to GF and lengths are given, points G and F must be elevated. Let G be (3, y, z) and F be (9, y, z) to maintain the parallel and length conditions. Using the distances AG = 8 and BF = 8, we set up equations:

1. √(3² + y² + z²) = 8 → y² + z² = 55
2. √((9-12)² + y² + z²) = 8 → y² + z² = 55 (same as above)

From these, we get x = 3 for G and x = 9 for F. Then, using the planarity condition for ADEG, we find z = 6, leading to y² = 19, so y = √19.

Next, point E is determined using the distance from E to face ABCD (z = 12) and CE = DE = 14. Solving for E, we find two possible coordinates: (6,16,12) and (6,8,12). 

We check both possibilities for E. Using E = (6,8,12) and G = (3, √19, 6), we compute EG²:

EG² = (6-3)² + (8-√19)² + (12-6)² = 9 + (64 - 16√19 + 19) + 36 = 128 - 16√19

This gives p = 128, q = 16, r = 19. Summing these: 128 + 16 + 19 = 163.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 4: <keep>Polyhedron $ABCDEFG$ has six faces.  Face $ABCD$ is a square with $AB = 12;$ face $ABFG$ is a trapezoid with $\overline{AB}$ parallel to $\overline{GF},$ $BF = AG = 8,$ and $GF = 6;$ and face $CDE$ has $CE = DE = 14.$ The other three faces are $ADEG, BCEF,$ and $EFG.$ The distance from $E$ to face $ABCD$ is 12.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 1: <keep>assign coordinates to the points to model this polyhedron in 3D space. Coordinates seem like the way to go here, especially since they mentioned the distance from E to the face ABCD is 12.</keep>

- Paragraph 6, Sentences 2-4: <keep>points F and G must be somewhere above the plane. Given that AB is from (0,0,0) to (12,0,0), and GF is parallel to AB (which is along the x-axis), GF should also be horizontal.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentences 1-2: <keep>AG = 8 and BF = 8, those distances must hold. Similarly, GF = 6. Since GF is supposed to be parallel to AB, so GF should also be horizontal, i.e., have the same direction as AB, which is along the x-axis.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentences 4-5: <keep>From point A(0,0,0) to G(a, b, c): distance is √[(a - 0)^2 + (b - 0)^2 + (c - 0)^2] = 8. Similarly, from point B(12,0,0) to F(a + 6 -12, b, c): distance is √[(a -6)^2 + b2 + c2] = 8.</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentences 1-3: <keep>Solving the equations for AG and BF, we find x = 3. Then substituting back into the equation, we get y² + z² = 55.</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentences 1-2: <keep>The planarity condition of the trapezoid ABFG ensures that points A, B, F, G are coplanar. Using the scalar triple product for coplanarity, we find the plane equation and constraints for G and F.</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentences 1-2: <keep>The distance from E to face ABCD is 12, implying E has a z-coordinate of 12. Solving CE = DE = 14, we find E's coordinates as (6,16,12) or (6,8,12).</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentences 1-2: <keep>Using the scalar triple product for coplanarity in face ADEG, we find z = 6 for points G and F. This leads to y² = 19, so y = √19.</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentences 1-2: <checking face BCEF's coplanarity, it's inherently satisfied given the problem's constraints. This doesn't provide new information but confirms the structure.</check>
- Paragraph 14, Sentences 1-2: <keep>For face EFG, calculating distances between E, F, and G. If E is (6,8,12), EG² = 128 - 16√19, leading to p = 128, q = 16, r = 19, summing to 163.</keep>
- Paragraph 15, Sentences 1-2: <keep>Verification with Heron's formula confirms the area of triangle CDE, ensuring consistency. The final answer is determined by the valid configuration of E and EG² calculation.</keep>
