Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. We need to find all positive integers \( n \) such that \( \sqrt{n^2 + 85n + 2017} \) is an integer, and then sum those integers up. Here's the detailed thought process:

1. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - Let \( m \) be the integer such that \( \sqrt{n^2 + 85n + 2017} = m \).
   - Squaring both sides gives the equation: \( n^2 + 85n + 2017 = m^2 \).

2. **Rearranging the Equation**:
   - Rewrite the equation as: \( m^2 - n^2 = 85n + 2017 \).
   - Using the difference of squares: \( (m - n)(m + n) = 85n + 2017 \).

3. **Expressing as a Product of Factors**:
   - Recognize that \( 85n + 2017 \) must be expressible as a product of two integers \( (m - n) \) and \( (m + n) \).
   - Let \( a = m - n \) and \( b = m + n \), so \( ab = 85n + 2017 \).

4. **Alternative Approach via Discriminant**:
   - Treat the original equation as a quadratic in \( n \): \( n^2 + 85n + (2017 - m^2) = 0 \).
   - The discriminant \( D = 85^2 - 4(2017 - m^2) \) must be a perfect square.
   - Simplify the discriminant: \( D = 4m^2 - 843 \).

5. **Formulating a New Equation**:
   - Set \( 4m^2 - k^2 = 843 \), which factors into \( (2m - k)(2m + k) = 843 \).

6. **Factorizing 843**:
   - Factor pairs of 843 are \( (1, 843) \) and \( (3, 281) \), since 843 is \( 3 \times 281 \).

7. **Solving for \( m \) and \( n \)**:
   - For each factor pair, solve for \( m \) and \( k \):
     - Pair (1, 843): \( m = 211 \), leading to \( n = 168 \).
     - Pair (3, 281): \( m = 71 \), leading to \( n = 27 \).

8. **Verification**:
   - Check that both \( n = 27 \) and \( n = 168 \) satisfy the original equation.
   - Compute \( \sqrt{n^2 + 85n + 2017} \) for both values, confirming it results in integers \( 71 \) and \( 211 \), respectively.

9. **Summing the Solutions**:
   - Sum the valid solutions: \( 27 + 168 = 195 \).

This method systematically narrows down the possible values of \( n \) by leveraging factorization and properties of quadratic equations, ensuring all steps are verifiable and thorough.
