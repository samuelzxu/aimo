Okay, let's tackle the problem of determining the day of the week for Lucy's 1000th day. She was born on Wednesday, December 1st, 2004. We need to find out what day of the week her 1000th day falls on. 

First, I recognize that each week has 7 days, so calculating the remainder when 1000 is divided by 7 will tell us how many days beyond complete weeks we need to count. Starting from day 1 as Wednesday, each additional day increments the day of the week. 

Calculating 1000 divided by 7 gives a quotient of 142 and a remainder of 6. But wait, this might be tricky. Let me double-check: 7*142 = 994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. The remainder is 6, so 1000 days is 142 weeks plus 6 days. However, starting from day 1 (Wednesday), day 8 would also be a Wednesday, which cycles every 7 days. 

Wait, perhaps I should adjust how we map the days. Assigning numbers to days where Wednesday is 0, Thursday is 1, up to Tuesday as 6. Then, for day n, the corresponding day of the week is (n-1) mod 7. For the 1000th day, (1000-1) mod 7 = 999 mod 7. Calculating 999 divided by 7 gives 142*7 = 994, remainder 5. So 999 mod 7 is 5, which corresponds to Monday.

But I need to verify this with another approach. Adding 999 days to December 1, 2004. Checking if any leap years fall within this period. The next leap year after 2004 is 2008, which is beyond our 999-day window. Thus, there are no leap days affecting the count. 

Calculating the actual date 999 days later, we find it's August 27, 2007. Using modular arithmetic, 999 days is 142 weeks and 5 days. Adding 5 days to Wednesday gives Monday. Cross-checking with the date August 27, 2007, confirms it was indeed a Monday. Both methods align, solidifying the conclusion.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 3: <keep>dividing 1000 by 7 will give the number of weeks and the remainder will tell me how many days beyond the last full week we need to count.</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 4: <keep>1000 divided by 7. Letâ€™s do the division. 7*142 is 994, because 7*140 is 980, and 7*2 is 14, so 980+14=994. Then, 1000-994=6. So the remainder is 6. That means 1000 days is 142 weeks and 6 days.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 3: <keep>If day 1 is Wednesday, then day 8 would be Wednesday again.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 2: <keep>Wednesday: 0

Thursday: 1

Friday: 2

Saturday: 3

Sunday: 4

Monday: 5

Tuesday: 6</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 3: <keep>the day of the week can be calculated as (n-1) mod7</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 5: <keep>compute (1000 -1) mod7 = 999 mod7.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 6: <keep>999 divided by 7.

Well, 7*142=994 as before, so 999-994=5. So 999 mod7=5.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 8: <keep>5 corresponds to Monday.</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 1: <keep>Wednesday +5 days = Monday (5)</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 2: <keep>the 1000th day is Monday.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 2: <keep>the 1000th day of her life, not 1000 days after December 1, 2004. But Lucy was born in 2004, so she has experienced the leap day in 2008, 2012, etc.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 4: <keep>the number of days modulo7 could have additional increments from leap days.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 1: <keep>compute the actual date 1000 days after December 1, 2004</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 3: <keep>Starting from December 1, 2004.

Day 1: Dec 1, 2004 (Wednesday)</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 3: <keep>From Dec 1, 2004, to Dec 1, 2005: 365 days. Then add another 365 days: Dec 1, 2006. That would be 730 days. Then 999 days would be 730 +269 days</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 4: <keep>August 27, 2007.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 5: <keep>August 27, 2007 was a Monday.</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 1: <keep>999 days is equivalent to 142 weeks and 5 days</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 3: <keep>Wednesday (0), Thursday (1), Friday (2), Saturday (3), Sunday (4), Monday (5). So 5 days after Wednesday is Monday.</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 1: <keep>269 days from Dec 1, 2006, to Aug 27, 2007.</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 2: <keep>269 mod7: Let's calculate 7*38=266. So 269-266=3. So 269 days mod7=3.</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 3: <keep>3 days after Friday: Sat, Sun, Mon. So August 27, 2007, three days after Friday is Monday.</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 1: <keep>the answer is Monday.</keep>
