Okay, so I need to figure out which parts of this long reasoning process are essential to keep for future steps. Let's start by breaking down the problem and the key points made in the thought process.

The problem is about representations of a finite p-group over a field of characteristic p. The key point is that if the restriction of the sum of all group elements' actions (denoted as T) to a subspace W is injective, then the span of the translates of W by the group elements is a direct sum.

The thinking process starts by recalling properties of p-groups and their representations in characteristic p. Then it explores different approaches: using the group algebra, considering nilpotent operators, minimal dependencies, applying group elements to equations, and induction arguments.

Key steps identified:
1. Assuming a non-trivial linear combination of ρ(g)w_g = 0 and using T's injectivity to deduce the sum of w_g is zero.
2. Applying group actions to shift indices and derive contradictions through minimality.
3. Using properties of the group algebra (nilpotence) and injectivity of T on W.

Important tokens to retain would include definitions (p-group, representation), key operators (T = Σρ(g)), injectivity condition, the deduction from applying T to the dependence relation (Σw_g = 0), and the minimality argument leading to contradiction.

Now, let's identify specific sentences and phrases that capture these essential points without unnecessary details. The kept text should form a coherent chain of reasoning necessary to reach the conclusion.
