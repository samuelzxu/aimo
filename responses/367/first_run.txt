Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. First, let's parse all the given information and see what we need to find.

We have two circles, C1 and C2. They intersect at two points, one of which is (9,6). The product of their radii is 68. Both circles are tangent to the x-axis and the line y = mx, where m > 0. We have to find m in the form a√b/c, with the usual conditions on a, b, c, and then compute a + b + c.

Alright, so we know both circles are tangent to the x-axis and another line y = mx. Since both circles are tangent to the x-axis, that gives us some information about their centers. If a circle is tangent to the x-axis, its radius must be equal to its y-coordinate. So, the centers of the circles will have coordinates (h, k), where k is the radius. Similarly, since they are also tangent to the line y = mx, the distance from the center (h, k) to this line must equal the radius k.

So, for any circle tangent to the x-axis, the center is (h, r), where r is the radius. The distance from the center (h, r) to the line y = mx is given by |mh - r| / sqrt(m² + 1) = r. Squaring both sides, we get:

(mh - r)² = r²(m² + 1)

Expanding and simplifying, we find:

m²h² - 2mhr + r² = r²m² + r²

This simplifies to:

m²h² - 2mhr = r²m²

Factoring out m, we get:

m(mh² - 2hr) = 0

Since m > 0, this implies:

m(h² - r²) - 2hr = 0 ⇒ m = (2hr)/(h² - r²)

Now, considering both circles passing through (9,6), we substitute this point into the circle equations. For each circle, the equation becomes:

(9 - h)² + (6 - r)² = r²

Expanding and simplifying, we find:

h² - 18h + 117 = 12r ⇒ r = (h² - 18h + 117)/12

Given the product of the radii r1 * r2 = 68, we substitute r1 and r2 with the expressions in terms of h1 and h2:

[(h1² - 18h1 + 117)/12] * [(h2² - 18h2 + 117)/12] = 68

This simplifies to:

(h1² - 18h1 + 117)(h2² - 18h2 + 117) = 9792

Next, we use the relation for m derived earlier for both circles:

m = (2h1r1)/(h1² - r1²) and m = (2h2r2)/(h2² - r2²)

Equating these two expressions for m and substituting r1 and r2 in terms of h1 and h2, we derive a quartic equation in h. Solving this quartic equation and considering the product of the roots, we find:

49m² = 136[1 + √(m² + 1)]

Letting n = √(m² + 1), we solve the quadratic equation to find n = 185/49. This leads to:

m = 12√221/49

Thus, a = 12, b = 221, c = 49, giving a + b + c = 282.
