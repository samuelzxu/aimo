Okay, let me try to figure out which parts of the reasoning are essential to keep for future steps. The user wants me to mark the critical tokens with <keep> tags so that the model can efficiently refer back to them without retaining unnecessary information. 

First, the problem is about counting numbers up to 2017 in base 3 with no zeros in their digits. The key steps are converting 2017 to base 3, calculating the numbers with digits 1 and 2 for different lengths, and handling the 7-digit numbers which require careful consideration to not exceed the converted base 3 number.

Looking at the provided reasoning:

1. The conversion of 2017 to base 3 is 2202201_3. This is crucial because all subsequent steps rely on this value.
2. The sum of numbers with 1 to 6 digits (2^1 to 2^6 = 126). This total is important as it's the base count before considering 7-digit numbers.
3. The breakdown of 7-digit numbers into cases where the first digit is 1 (64 numbers) and where the first two digits are 2 followed by 1 (32 numbers). These cases are vital as they explain how the 96 count for 7-digit numbers is derived.
4. The explanation that numbers starting with 22 in base 3 exceed the limit due to the third digit being 0, making them invalid. This shows why other cases aren't considered.
5. Adding the 126 and 96 to get the final answer 222. This is the conclusion.

Other details, like verifying each step of the base 3 conversion or decimal conversions, might be less critical once the main points are established. The key points are the converted base 3 number, the counts for each digit length, the valid 7-digit cases, and the exclusion of invalid cases. The final answer is essential to retain as well.

- Paragraph 1, Sentence 2: <keep>numbers less than or equal to 2017 whose base-three (ternary) representation contains no digit equal to 0</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 2: <keep>convert the number 2017 into base-three</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 4: <keep>2017 in base-three is 2202201_3</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 3: <keep>numbers with digits only 1 or 2 in base-three</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 1: <keep>sum from 1 to 6 digits, which is 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^6 =126</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 2: <keep>number of 7-digit numbers in base-three (all digits 1 or 2) less than or equal to 2202201_3</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 1: <keep>Case 1: First digit is 1. Then digits 2 to 7 can be any combination of 1s and 2s. So the count here is 2^6 = 64</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 2: <keep>Case 2: First digit is 2</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 1: <keep>Case 2a: d1=2, d2=1. Then digits d3 to d7 can be anything (1 or 2). So how many numbers: 1*1*2^5=32</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 2: <keep>Case 2b: d1=2, d2=2. Then we need to look at d3. The upper limit's d3 is 0, but our number has d3 >=1 (since digits can't be 0). Therefore, any number with d1=2, d2=2, d3>=1 would be larger than 2202201_3</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 1: <keep>total for case 2: 32+0=32</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 2: <keep>total numbers for 7-digit numbers is case1 + case2 =64 +32=96</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 1: <keep>total numbers required would be 126 (from 1-6 digits) +96=222</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 1: <keep>numbers starting with 22 in base-three with digits 1 or 2, beyond d1 and d2=2, automatically make them higher than 2202201_3</keep>
