Okay, let's go through the problem step by step. We need to determine which of the given functions belong to the set S, meaning they are solutions to the differential equation dy/dx + α y = x e^{β x} with the initial condition y(1) = 1 for some real numbers α and β.

First, recall the general solution method for linear first-order differential equations. The equation is of the form dy/dx + P(x)y = Q(x), which can be solved using an integrating factor. For our specific equation, the integrating factor is e^{α x}, leading to the solution:

y(x) = e^{-α x} [C + ∫ x e^{(α + β)x} dx]

After integrating and applying the initial condition y(1) = 1, we split into two cases: β ≠ -α and β = -α.

**Case 1 (β ≠ -α):**
The solution combines the homogeneous and particular solutions:
y(x) = C e^{-α x} + e^{β x} [x/(α + β) - 1/(α + β)^2]

**Case 2 (β = -α):**
Here, the particular solution includes a quadratic term due to resonance:
y(x) = e^{-α x} [C + (x^2/2)]

**Option A Analysis:**
f(x) = (x²/2) e^{-x} + (e - 1/2) e^{-x}

- This matches the form of Case 2 with α = 1 and β = -1.
- Substitute α = 1 into the general solution: y(x) = e^{-x} (e - 1/2 + x²/2), which matches Option A.
- Check initial condition: f(1) = 1, which holds true.

**Option B Analysis:**
f(x) = -(x²/2) e^{-x} + (e + 1/2) e^{-x}

- The negative x² term doesn't fit Case 2 (which has +x²/2).
- Checking Case 1 leads to contradictions, as shown in detailed steps.

**Option C Analysis:**
f(x) = (e^x/2)(x - 1/2) + (e - e²/4) e^{-x}

- Matches Case 1 with α = 1 and β = 1.
- Substitute α = 1 and β = 1 into the general solution, which matches Option C.
- Initial condition f(1) = 1 is satisfied.

**Option D Analysis:**
f(x) = (e^x/2)(1/2 - x) + (e + e²/4) e^{-x}

- Analyzing the differential equation and initial conditions shows inconsistencies, as detailed steps indicate no valid α and β exist.

**Final Conclusion:**
Options A and C fit the required form with valid α and β values, while B and D do not. Therefore, the correct answers are A and C.
