Okay, let me go through the problem again step by step to make sure I didn't miss anything. The task is to find the value of (ρ_i T_i)/(ρ_a T_a) - 1 using the given parameters. 

First, I connected this expression to the ideal gas law. Since ρ is proportional to P/(RT), the ratio (ρ_i T_i)/(ρ_a T_a) simplifies to P_i/P_a. This means the target expression becomes P_i/P_a - 1.

Next, determining P_i. Surface tension γ and radius R0 are provided, which hints at using the Laplace pressure equation. The key was figuring out whether to use 2γ/R or 4γ/R. Considering the problem context (gas bubble in a liquid), the correct pressure difference is 2γ/R. 

Calculating ΔP = 2γ/R0 = 0.05 N/m². Then, ΔP/P_a = 0.05 / 101300 ≈ 4.936e-5. Rounding to three significant figures gives 4.94e-5.

Key steps to retain:
1. Relation between (ρ_i T_i)/(ρ_a T_a) and pressure ratio via ideal gas law.
2. Applying Laplace pressure with ΔP = 2γ/R for a gas bubble in liquid.
3. Calculation steps leading to the final result.
