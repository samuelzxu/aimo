Okay, let's break down how I approached this problem. The task was to find a function f(p, q) defined on ordered pairs of nonnegative integers that satisfies specific conditions. The function is zero when either p or q is zero, and otherwise, it's defined recursively. 

First, I considered small cases to spot a pattern. For example, starting with (1,1), then moving to (2,1) and (1,2). Through these calculations, I noticed the results were 1, 2, 2 respectively, which looked like multiplication of p and q. Testing this hypothesis with larger values like (2,2) and (3,1), the pattern held, giving 4 and 3. 

Next, I verified if f(p, q) = pq satisfies the given functional equation. Expanding the equation with this assumption showed both sides matched, confirming it's a valid solution. 

I also checked uniqueness by considering the recursive structure, realizing that each value depends on others closer to the boundary, ensuring the solution is uniquely determined. Additional checks with (3,2), (4,1), and (2,3) further validated the solution. 

The critical points where the function's values depend on each other were essential to retain, especially those showing the recursive dependencies and symmetry. Marking these parts helps in maintaining the necessary context for future steps without overloading with redundant information.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 1: <keep>The function is defined recursively here. When \( pq = 0 \), it's zero, so any state where one of the coordinates is zero is a base case with value zero.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 1: <keep>First, consider \( p = 1, q = 1 \). Then:</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 3: <keep>But \( f(2, 0) = 0 \) and \( f(0, 2) = 0 \), so:</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 1: <keep>Next, \( p = 2, q = 1 \):</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 1: <keep>For \( f(1, 2) \):</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 3: <keep>\( f(0, 3) = 0 \), so:</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 1: <keep>Subtract \( \frac{1}{4}f(2, 1) \) both sides:</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 1: <keep>So \( f(1, 2) = 2 \), \( f(2, 1) = 2 \).</keep>

- Paragraph 13, Sentence 1: <keep>Subtract \( \frac{1}{2}f(2,2) \):</keep>
- Paragraph 14, Sentence 1: <keep>Then, \( f(3,1) = 1 + \frac{1}{2}(4) = 1 + 2 = 3 \).</keep>
- Paragraph 16, Sentence 1: <keep>This seems like \( f(p, q) = pq \). Let's test if this satisfies the recurrence.</keep>
- Paragraph 18, Sentence 1: <keep>Multiply out the terms:</keep>
- Paragraph 19, Sentence 1: <keep>Left-hand side of the functional equation:</keep>
- Paragraph 21, Sentence 1: <keep>But wait, the problem asks to "find all functions" satisfying the equation.</keep>
- Paragraph 22, Sentence 1: <keep>Let me verify another case. Letâ€™s try \( f(3,2) \).</keep>
