Alright, let me try to break down how to approach this problem. The goal is to express 2008 as a combination of distinct powers of 3 with coefficients of either 1 or -1, and then find the sum of all the exponents used. 

First, I recall that balanced ternary representation uses digits -1, 0, and 1, but the problem requires all coefficients to be non-zero (either 1 or -1). So, I need to convert 2008 into such a form without zeros.

Starting with the standard balanced ternary conversion:
1. Divide 2008 by 3 repeatedly, adjusting remainders to be -1, 0, or 1 by carrying over when necessary.
2. This process yields the balanced ternary digits for 2008: \(1, 0, -1, 1, -1, 1, 0, 1\) corresponding to the exponents \(3^7, 3^6, 3^5, 3^4, 3^3, 3^2, 3^1, 3^0\).

However, this includes zeros at \(3^6\) and \(3^1\), which we need to eliminate. Since the problem allows only non-zero coefficients, we exclude these zero terms. The relevant terms with coefficients 1 or -1 are:
- \(3^7\)
- \(-3^5\)
- \(3^4\)
- \(-3^3\)
- \(3^2\)
- \(3^0\)

Summing these exponents: \(7 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 0 = 21\).

Verifying the calculation:
\[
3^7 - 3^5 + 3^4 - 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^0 = 2187 - 243 + 81 - 27 + 9 + 1 = 2008
\]
This confirms the correct expression, and the sum of the exponents is indeed 21.
