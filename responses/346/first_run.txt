Alright, I need to determine which tokens in the provided reasoning trace are essential for future steps. Let's go through each part carefully.

Starting with the problem setup for part (1), the user solves a system of differential equations. Key steps include forming the matrix, finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors, solving for the particular solution, applying initial conditions, and verifying the solution. The critical parts here are the eigenvalues (2 ± i), the particular solution [2; 1], the homogeneous solution involving exponential and trigonometric terms, and the constants determined from initial conditions (C1 = -2, C2 = 1). These elements are crucial for reconstructing the final solution.

For part (2), the physics problem involves a pendulum starting from an unstable equilibrium. The user sets up the differential equation using torque considerations and energy conservation. The transformation of variables and integration leading to the logarithmic term is essential here. However, since the user focused more on part (1) and provided a detailed solution there, the key elements for part (2) include the energy conservation equation, substitution using θ, and the integral leading to the log expression, even though the integral's evaluation is complex.

Notably, the final answers for part (1) are the boxed expressions for x(t) and y(t). The detailed verification steps (checking derivatives and substitution methods) confirm the solution's correctness but might be too verbose. However, the core equations and constants derived are necessary.

Now, I'll identify specific paragraphs and sentences where essential tokens should be kept using <keep> tags.
