Okay, let's figure out which parts of the reasoning are essential to keep for future steps.

First, the problem involves a cyclic hexagon with sides 3,3,3,5,5,5. The key chord divides it into two trapezoids. The main goal is to find the length of this chord.

The critical steps are:
1. Setting up the central angles α for the sides of length 3 and β for the sides of length 5.
2. Establishing the relationship 3α + 3β = 360°, leading to α + β = 120°.
3. Using the chord length formula to express 3 and 5 in terms of R (radius) and sin(α/2) or sin(β/2).
4. Deriving equations: 3 = 2R sin(α/2) and 5 = 2R sin(β/2).
5. Expressing sin(β/2) in terms of α using trigonometric identities.
6. Solving for R by combining these equations, resulting in R = 7/√3.
7. Calculating the central angle for chord AD (3α) and using the chord length formula again.
8. Using trigonometric identities to find sin(3α/2) and compute the chord length as 360/49.

The essential tokens include the relationships between angles, the chord formulas, solving for R, and the final chord length calculation. These steps are crucial for deriving the answer without redundancy.
