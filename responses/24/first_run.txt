Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. We need to prove that any two minimal saddle pairs contain the same number of rows. 

First, let's recap the definitions. A saddle pair (R, C) consists of a set of rows R and columns C such that:
1. Every row is dominated by some row in R over the columns in C.
2. Every column is dominated by some column in C over the rows in R.
A minimal saddle pair is one where no subset of R or C can form a valid saddle pair.

To show that all minimal pairs have the same number of rows, consider two minimal saddle pairs, (R1, C1) and (R2, C2). We'll construct injective mappings between R1 and R2 to prove |R1| = |R2|.

For each row r1 in R1, since (R2, C2) is a saddle pair, there exists a row r2 in R2 that dominates r1 over C2. Define a function f: R1 → R2 mapping each r1 to such an r2. Similarly, define a function g: R2 → R1 where each r2 in R2 maps to a row in R1 that dominates it over C1.

If f were not injective, there would be distinct rows r1, r2 in R1 mapping to the same row in R2. This would imply redundancy in R1, contradicting its minimality. Similarly, g must also be injective. Thus, |R1| ≤ |R2| and |R2| ≤ |R1|, so |R1| = |R2|. Hence, all minimal saddle pairs have the same number of rows.
