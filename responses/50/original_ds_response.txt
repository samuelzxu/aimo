Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, we have the equation:

\[
\log_{20x} (22x) = \log_{2x} (202x)
\]

and we need to find \(\log_{20x} (22x)\) in terms of \(\log_{10} (\tfrac{m}{n})\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime positive integers, and then compute \(m + n\).

First, let me recall some logarithmic identities that might help here. The change of base formula is useful for comparing logarithms with different bases. The formula says that:

\[
\log_b a = \frac{\log_c a}{\log_c b}
\]

for any positive number \(c \neq 1\). Maybe I can use this to express both sides with the same base, say base 10, and then set them equal to each other. Let me try that.

Let’s denote \(y = \log_{20x}(22x)\). Then according to the equation, \(y = \log_{2x}(202x)\). Using the change of base formula:

Left-hand side (LHS):

\[
y = \frac{\log_{10}(22x)}{\log_{10}(20x)}
\]

Right-hand side (RHS):

\[
y = \frac{\log_{10}(202x)}{\log_{10}(2x)}
\]

Since both are equal to \(y\), we can set them equal to each other:

\[
\frac{\log_{10}(22x)}{\log_{10}(20x)} = \frac{\log_{10}(202x)}{\log_{10}(2x)}
\]

Hmm. So, cross-multiplying to eliminate the denominators:

\[
\log_{10}(22x) \cdot \log_{10}(2x) = \log_{10}(202x) \cdot \log_{10}(20x)
\]

But I need to solve for \(x\) here, which is kind of complicated because of all these logarithmic terms. Maybe I can simplify each logarithm expression? Let's expand each term using log properties.

First, recall that \(\log(a \cdot b) = \log a + \log b\), so:

\[
\log_{10}(22x) = \log_{10}22 + \log_{10}x
\]
\[
\log_{10}(20x) = \log_{10}20 + \log_{10}x
\]
\[
\log_{10}(2x) = \log_{10}2 + \log_{10}x
\]
\[
\log_{10}(202x) = \log_{10}202 + \log_{10}x
\]

So, let me substitute these into the equation:

Left-hand side:

\[
(\log_{10}22 + \log_{10}x)(\log_{10}2 + \log_{10}x)
\]

Right-hand side:

\[
(\log_{10}202 + \log_{10}x)(\log_{10}20 + \log_{10}x)
\]

This looks messy, but maybe if I let \(t = \log_{10}x\), the equation becomes one variable in terms of \(t\). Let me try that substitution.

Let \(t = \log_{10}x\). Then:

Left-hand side becomes:

\[
(\log_{10}22 + t)(\log_{10}2 + t)
\]

Right-hand side becomes:

\[
(\log_{10}202 + t)(\log_{10}20 + t)
\]

So, expanding both sides:

Left-hand side:

First, multiply \(\log_{10}22 \cdot \log_{10}2\):

\[
\log_{10}22 \cdot \log_{10}2
\]
Plus \(\log_{10}22 \cdot t\):
\[
\log_{10}22 \cdot t
\]
Plus \(t \cdot \log_{10}2\):
\[
t \cdot \log_{10}2
\]
Plus \(t \cdot t\):
\[
t^2
\]

So overall:

\[
t^2 + t(\log_{10}22 + \log_{10}2) + \log_{10}22 \cdot \log_{10}2
\]

Similarly, the right-hand side:

Multiply \(\log_{10}202 \cdot \log_{10}20\):

\[
\log_{10}202 \cdot \log_{10}20
\]
Plus \(\log_{10}202 \cdot t\):
\[
\log_{10}202 \cdot t
\]
Plus \(t \cdot \log_{10}20\):
\[
t \cdot \log_{10}20
\]
Plus \(t \cdot t\):
\[
t^2
\]

So overall:

\[
t^2 + t(\log_{10}202 + \log_{10}20) + \log_{10}202 \cdot \log_{10}20
\]

Setting LHS equal to RHS:

\[
t^2 + t(\log_{10}22 + \log_{10}2) + \log_{10}22 \cdot \log_{10}2 = t^2 + t(\log_{10}202 + \log_{10}20) + \log_{10}202 \cdot \log_{10}20
\]

Subtracting \(t^2\) from both sides cancels them out, so we have:

\[
t(\log_{10}22 + \log_{10}2) + \log_{10}22 \cdot \log_{10}2 = t(\log_{10}202 + \log_{10}20) + \log_{10}202 \cdot \log_{10}20
\]

Bring all terms to the left-hand side:

\[
t(\log_{10}22 + \log_{10}2 - \log_{10}202 - \log_{10}20) + \log_{10}22 \cdot \log_{10}2 - \log_{10}202 \cdot \log_{10}20 = 0
\]

So,

\[
t \cdot \left[ (\log_{10}22 - \log_{10}202) + (\log_{10}2 - \log_{10}20) \right] + \left[ \log_{10}22 \cdot \log_{10}2 - \log_{10}202 \cdot \log_{10}20 \right] = 0
\]

Simplify the coefficients of \(t\) and the constant terms.

First, let's compute \((\log_{10}22 - \log_{10}202)\) and \((\log_{10}2 - \log_{10}20)\):

\(\log_{10}22 - \log_{10}202 = \log_{10}(22/202) = \log_{10}(11/101)\) (since 22/202 = 11/101)

\(\log_{10}2 - \log_{10}20 = \log_{10}(2/20) = \log_{10}(1/10) = -1\)

So, the coefficient of \(t\) becomes:

\(\log_{10}(11/101) - 1\)

Now, the constant term:

\(\log_{10}22 \cdot \log_{10}2 - \log_{10}202 \cdot \log_{10}20\)

Let me note that 202 is 2*101 and 20 is 2*10. So perhaps 202 and 20 are related? Let's see.

But, \(202 = 2 \times 101\), and \(20 = 2 \times 10\). Not sure if that helps. Also, 22 is 2 × 11. Maybe these factorizations can help in expressing the logs?

Let's write out each term:

First term: \(\log_{10}22 \cdot \log_{10}2\):

= \(\log_{10}(2 \times 11) \cdot \log_{10}2\)

= \((\log_{10}2 + \log_{10}11) \cdot \log_{10}2\)

= \((\log_{10}2)^2 + \log_{10}11 \cdot \log_{10}2\)

Second term: \(\log_{10}202 \cdot \log_{10}20\):

= \(\log_{10}(2 \times 101) \cdot \log_{10}(2 \times 10)\)

= \((\log_{10}2 + \log_{10}101) \cdot (\log_{10}2 + \log_{10}10)\)

= \((\log_{10}2 + \log_{10}101) \cdot (\log_{10}2 + 1)\)

Multiply this out:

= \(\log_{10}2 \cdot \log_{10}2 + \log_{10}2 \cdot 1 + \log_{10}101 \cdot \log_{10}2 + \log_{10}101 \cdot 1\)

= \((\log_{10}2)^2 + \log_{10}2 + \log_{10}101 \cdot \log_{10}2 + \log_{10}101\)

So, subtracting the second term from the first:

First term - second term:

\[ [(\log_{10}2)^2 + \log_{10}11 \cdot \log_{10}2] - [(\log_{10}2)^2 + \log_{10}2 + \log_{10}101 \cdot \log_{10}2 + \log_{10}101] \]

Simplify term by term:

- \((\log_{10}2)^2 - (\log_{10}2)^2 = 0\)

- \(\log_{10}11 \cdot \log_{10}2 - \log_{10}2 = \log_{10}2 (\log_{10}11 - 1)\)

- Remaining terms: \(- \log_{10}101 \cdot \log_{10}2 - \log_{10}101\)

= \(- \log_{10}101 (\log_{10}2 + 1)\)

So overall, the constant term is:

\[
\log_{10}2 (\log_{10}11 - 1) - \log_{10}101 (\log_{10}2 + 1)
\]

This seems complicated. Maybe factor out \(\log_{10}2\) or something else? Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps let me use more substitutions. Let me denote \(a = \log_{10}2\), \(b = \log_{10}11\), \(c = \log_{10}101\). Then, the constant term can be written as:

\[
a(b - 1) - c(a + 1)
\]

Which simplifies to:

\[
ab - a - ac - c = a(b - c - 1) - c
\]

But maybe this isn't helpful. Alternatively, perhaps notice that 101 and 11 are primes, and likely won't simplify. Perhaps I need to express terms numerically? However, since the problem is expecting an exact answer in terms of log base 10 of a fraction, probably the messy terms need to cancel out in some way. Maybe we should find a better approach instead of expanding all this.

Alternatively, perhaps start over. Let me denote \(y = \log_{20x}(22x)\), which is equal to \(\log_{2x}(202x)\). The problem states that this value can be written as \(\log_{10}(m/n)\). Maybe if I can relate the two logarithmic expressions through their relationship.

Alternatively, let me recall that if \(\log_b a = \log_d c\), then there exists some number \(k\) such that \(a = b^k\) and \(c = d^k\). So in this case, if we set:

\[
22x = (20x)^k \\
202x = (2x)^k
\]

And these two equations must hold for the same \(k\). Thus, we can set these two equations:

1. \(22x = (20x)^k\)
2. \(202x = (2x)^k\)

Now, we have a system of equations with two variables \(x\) and \(k\). Let me try to solve for \(x\) and \(k\). First, from the first equation:

\(22x = (20x)^k\)

Similarly, from the second equation:

\(202x = (2x)^k\)

Perhaps we can divide these two equations to eliminate \(x\)? Let's see.

Divide equation 2 by equation 1:

\[
\frac{202x}{22x} = \frac{(2x)^k}{(20x)^k}
\]

Simplify:

Left side: \(\frac{202}{22} = \frac{101}{11}\)

Right side: \(\left(\frac{2x}{20x}\right)^k = \left(\frac{1}{10}\right)^k = 10^{-k}\)

Therefore:

\[
\frac{101}{11} = 10^{-k}
\]

Taking logarithms base 10:

\[
\log_{10}\left(\frac{101}{11}\right) = -k \implies k = -\log_{10}\left(\frac{101}{11}\right) = \log_{10}\left(\frac{11}{101}\right)
\]

So, \(k = \log_{10}(11/101)\). But the problem states that \(k = \log_{10}(m/n)\). So, if \(11\) and \(101\) are coprime, which they are (since 101 is prime and 11 < 101 and doesn't divide it), then \(m = 11\), \(n = 101\), so \(m + n = 11 + 101 = 112\). Wait, is that correct? But hold on, let me verify.

Wait, no. The problem states that \(\log_{20x}(22x) = \log_{10}(m/n)\), so if \(k = \log_{20x}(22x)\), which we found as \(\log_{10}(11/101)\). So yes, \(k = \log_{10}(11/101)\), meaning \(m = 11\), \(n = 101\), hence \(m + n = 112\).

But before I jump to conclusions, let me check if this answer makes sense and that the steps are correct. The key step was creating those two equations: \(22x = (20x)^k\) and \(202x = (2x)^k\), then dividing them to eliminate \(x\). Let's see:

From division:

\(202x / 22x = (2x)^k / (20x)^k\)

The \(x\) cancels on the left, and on the right, \(\left( \frac{2}{20} \times \frac{x}{x} \right)^k = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right)^k\). So that step is correct. Then, 202/22 reduces to 101/11, so 101/11 = (1/10)^k. Taking logs gives \(\log_{10}(101/11) = \log_{10}(10^{-k})\), which gives \( \log_{10}(101/11) = -k \), leading to \(k = - \log_{10}(101/11) = \log_{10}(11/101)\). Therefore, yes, since \(k\) was defined as \(\log_{20x}(22x)\), which is equal to \(\log_{10}(11/101)\). Therefore, the answer is \(11 + 101 = 112\).

Wait, but to ensure everything is correct, perhaps check if this \(k\) leads to a valid \(x\). Let's attempt to compute \(x\) to confirm.

From equation 1: \(22x = (20x)^k\)

We have \(k = \log_{10}(11/101)\), so let's write \(k = \log_{10}(11) - \log_{10}(101)\). Then, \(10^k = \frac{11}{101}\).

But we need to express \( (20x)^k = 20^k x^k \). So the equation is:

22x = 20^k x^k

We can rearrange for x:

22 = 20^k x^{k -1}

Similarly, from equation 2:

202x = (2x)^k = 2^k x^k

So,

202x = 2^k x^k

Solve for x:

202 = 2^k x^{k -1}

Therefore, both equations give us expressions for x^{k -1}:

From equation 1: x^{k -1} = 22 / 20^k

From equation 2: x^{k -1} = 202 / 2^k

Therefore,

22 / 20^k = 202 / 2^k

Cross-multiply:

22 * 2^k = 202 * 20^k

Divide both sides by 2:

11 * 2^k = 101 * 20^k

But 20^k = 20^k, so:

11 = 101 * (20/2)^k

Wait, 20/2 is 10. So:

11 = 101 * 10^k

But 10^k = (11)/101, from our earlier result (since 10^k = 10^{\log_{10}(11/101)}} = 11/101). Therefore:

11 = 101 * (11/101) = 11.

Which checks out. Therefore, the value of \(x\) is consistent with the equations, which gives me confidence that \(k = \log_{10}(11/101)\) is indeed the correct value. Thus, the final answer is \(11 + 101 = 112\).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{112}
