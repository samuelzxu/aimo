Okay, let's break down where the essential tokens are in this reasoning process.

First, the problem setup is given with the logarithmic equation. The key steps involve applying the change of base formula and setting up equations. The substitution of \( y = \log_{20x}(22x) \) and using the change of base formula to express both sides in terms of base 10 logarithms is crucial. The cross-multiplication step to eliminate denominators leads to an equation involving products of logarithms, which is then simplified by introducing \( t = \log_{10}x \).

The expansion of both sides after substituting \( t \) shows the quadratic structure in \( t \), but this approach becomes complex. The critical shift occurs when considering the property that equal logarithms imply the arguments are powers of their respective bases. This leads to setting up two equations for \( 22x \) and \( 202x \) as powers of \( 20x \) and \( 2x \) with the same exponent \( k \).

Dividing these equations eliminates \( x \) and allows solving for \( k \), which directly gives the value of the original logarithm in terms of \( \log_{10}(11/101) \). The verification step confirming \( k \) satisfies both original equations is important for ensuring correctness, but the essential result is the expression for \( k \) and thus \( m + n \).

Key tokens include the substitution \( y = \log_{20x}(22x) \), the cross-multiplication step, the introduction of \( t \), the subsequent realization to use the exponent \( k \), dividing the equations to solve for \( k \), and the final identification of \( m \) and \( n \).

- Paragraph 3, Sentence 1: <keep>Using the change of base formula:</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentences 3-4: <keep>Left-hand side (LHS):

\[
y = \frac{\log_{10}(22x)}{\log_{10}(20x)}
\]</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentences 5-6: <keep>Right-hand side (RHS):

\[
y = \frac{\log_{10}(202x)}{\log_{10}(2x)}
\]</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 1: <keep>Since both are equal to \(y\), we can set them equal to each other:</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 2: <keep>\[
\frac{\log_{10}(22x)}{\log_{10}(20x)} = \frac{\log_{10}(202x)}{\log_{10}(2x)}
\]</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 1: <keep>So, cross-multiplying to eliminate the denominators:</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 2: <keep>\[
\log_{10}(22x) \cdot \log_{10}(2x) = \log_{10}(202x) \cdot \log_{10}(20x)
\]</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 3: <keep>Let \(t = \log_{10}x\). Then:</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentences 1-2: <keep>Left-hand side becomes:

\[
(\log_{10}22 + t)(\log_{10}2 + t)
\]</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentences 3-4: <keep>Right-hand side becomes:

\[
(\log_{10}202 + t)(\log_{10}20 + t)
\]</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 2: <keep>Subtracting \(t^2\) from both sides cancels them out, so we have:</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 3: <keep>\[
t(\log_{10}22 + \log_{10}2) + \log_{10}22 \cdot \log_{10}2 = t(\log_{10}202 + \log_{10}20) + \log_{10}202 \cdot \log_{10}20
\]</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentences 3-4: <keep>\(\log_{10}22 - \log_{10}202 = \log_{10}(22/202) = \log_{10}(11/101)\)

\(\log_{10}2 - \log_{10}20 = \log_{10}(2/20) = \log_{10}(1/10) = -1\)</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentence 5: <keep>\(\log_{10}(11/101) - 1\)</keep>
- Paragraph 16, Sentence 1: <keep>Alternatively, let me recall that if \(\log_b a = \log_d c\), then there exists some number \(k\) such that \(a = b^k\) and \(c = d^k\).</keep>
- Paragraph 16, Sentences 2-3: <keep>So in this case, if we set:

\[
22x = (20x)^k \\
202x = (2x)^k
\]</keep>
- Paragraph 17, Sentences 1-2: <keep>Divide equation 2 by equation 1:

\[
\frac{202x}{22x} = \frac{(2x)^k}{(20x)^k}
\]</keep>
- Paragraph 17, Sentences 3-4: <keep>Left side: \(\frac{202}{22} = \frac{101}{11}\)

Right side: \(\left(\frac{2x}{20x}\right)^k = \left(\frac{1}{10}\right)^k = 10^{-k}\)</keep>
- Paragraph 17, Sentence 5: <keep>\[
\frac{101}{11} = 10^{-k}
\]</keep>
- Paragraph 18, Sentences 1-2: <keep>Taking logarithms base 10:

\[
\log_{10}\left(\frac{101}{11}\right) = -k \implies k = -\log_{10}\left(\frac{101}{11}\right) = \log_{10}\left(\frac{11}{101}\right)
\]</keep>
- Paragraph 19, Sentences 2-3: <keep>\(k = \log_{10}(11/101)\). But the problem states that \(k = \log_{10}(m/n)\). So, if \(11\) and \(101\) are coprime, which they are (since 101 is prime and 11 < 101 and doesn't divide it), then \(m = 11\), \(n = 101\), so \(m + n = 11 + 101 = 112\).</keep>
- Paragraph 20, Sentences 4-5: <keep>From equation 1: \(22x = (20x)^k\)

We have \(k = \log_{10}(11/101)\), so let's write \(k = \log_{10}(11) - \log_{10}(101)\). Then, \(10^k = \frac{11}{101}\).</keep>
- Paragraph 21, Sentence 2: <keep>11 = 101 * 10^k</keep>
- Paragraph 21, Sentences 3-4: <keep>But 10^k = (11)/101, from our earlier result (since 10^k = 10^{\log_{10}(11/101)}} = 11/101). Therefore:

11 = 101 * (11/101) = 11.</keep>
- Paragraph 22, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, the value of \(x\) is consistent with the equations, which gives me confidence that \(k = \log_{10}(11/101)\) is indeed the correct value.</keep>
