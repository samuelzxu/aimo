Okay, let's break down the problem step by step. We have triangle ABC where median AD makes a 45-degree angle with side BC. We need to find the absolute value of the difference between cot B and cot C.

First, since AD is a median, D is the midpoint of BC. The angle between AD and BC is given as 45 degrees. To simplify calculations, we can place the triangle in a coordinate system. Let's set B at (-1, 0), C at (1, 0), making D the origin (0, 0). The median AD from point A (t, t) to D (0, 0) has a slope of 1, ensuring the 45-degree angle with BC.

Next, we compute the vectors BA and BC to find angle B. Vector BA is (t + 1, t) and vector BC is (2, 0). Using the dot product, we find cos(theta_B) and tan(theta_B), leading to cot B = (t + 1)/t.

For angle C, vectors CA and CB are (t - 1, t) and (-2, 0) respectively. Similar calculations using the dot and cross products give cot C = (1 - t)/t.

Subtracting cot C from cot B results in ((t + 1)/t) - ((1 - t)/t) = 2, regardless of the value of t. Thus, the absolute value |cot B - cot C| is always 2.
