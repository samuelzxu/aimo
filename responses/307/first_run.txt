Okay, let's try to figure out which parts of the reasoning are essential to keep for future steps. The problem involves proving that \( a_n < \frac{1}{n-1} \) given a recursive equation involving terms \( a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_n \). The key steps involve recognizing the recurrence relation, transforming it into a telescoping sequence, and using induction or bounds based on the properties of the sequence.

First, the initial observations about the recurrence relations for specific \( k \) values (like \( k=1 \) and \( k=2 \)) set up the understanding. The critical point here is noting that each adjacent pair of terms sums to less than 1, derived from the given equation. This leads to the general conclusion that \( a_{k} + a_{k+1} < 1 \) for all applicable \( k \), which is crucial for establishing bounds later.

Next, the transformation using \( x_k = a_{k-1} + a_k \) simplifies the recurrence relation into a telescoping sequence. The step where \( x_{k+1} = \frac{x_k}{x_k + 1} \) is pivotal. This recursive formula allows the derivation of a general form for \( x_k \) in terms of \( x_1 = s \), leading to \( x_k = \frac{s}{1 + (k-1)s} \). This formula is fundamental as it directly links the initial term \( s \) with subsequent terms and ultimately \( x_n \).

The key realization here is that \( x_n = \frac{s}{1 + (n-1)s} \) and recognizing that \( a_n < x_n \) because \( a_{n-1} \) is positive. The final step involves analyzing the function \( f(s) = \frac{s}{1 + (n-1)s} \), showing it's increasing but bounded above by \( \frac{1}{n-1} \) as \( s \) approaches infinity. This analysis conclusively proves the required inequality.

All these steps are necessary for the proof. The specific mathematical manipulations, the recursive formula, and the bounding argument using the function's behavior are essential. Missing any of these would make the proof incomplete or unclear. Therefore, the critical paragraphs and sentences that establish these points need to be preserved.
