Okay, let's see. The user wants me to identify which parts of the existing reasoning are essential to keep for future steps. The problem involves complex numbers forming a right triangle, Vieta's formulas, and sum of magnitudes squared. The key steps here are:

1. **Vieta's Formulas**: The roots a, b, c of the polynomial have a sum of zero. This is crucial because it leads to c = -a - b, simplifying later expressions.
2. **Sum of Magnitudes Squared**: The given |a|² + |b|² + |c|² = 250. This is directly used in the formula for the sum of squares of the sides of the triangle.
3. **Sum of Squares of Sides**: The critical realization is that the sum of the squares of all three sides of a right triangle equals twice the square of the hypotenuse. This connects the given sum of magnitudes to the desired hypotenuse squared.

The part where the user uses the formula for the sum of squares of the sides (|a−b|² + |b−c|² + |c−a|²) being equal to 3(|a|² + |b|² + |c|²) because a + b + c = 0 is vital. Then, applying the right triangle property to divide by two for h² is the key step. These sections must be marked as essential because they form the logical backbone leading directly to the solution.
