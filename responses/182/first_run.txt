Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Anna and Berta are playing a marble game where they take turns removing marbles under specific rules. Anna goes first, and the goal is to find the smallest N ≥ 100,000 such that Berta can force a win if there are N marbles initially.

First, I need to understand the game rules thoroughly. When there are n marbles on the table, the player can remove k marbles where k is either an even number ≤ n/2 or an odd number between n/2 and n (inclusive). The player who takes the last marble wins.

This sounds like a combinatorial game theory problem where we need to identify "losing positions" (P-positions) where the current player cannot force a win, assuming optimal play. Since Berta is the second player, we're looking for N such that the starting position N is a P-position.

To find the pattern, let's analyze smaller values of n:

- **n=1**: Anna takes 1 and wins. Winning position (N-position).
- **n=2**: Anna can only take 1, leaving 1 for Berta, who wins. Losing position (P-position).
- **n=3**: Anna takes all 3 and wins. N-position.
- **n=4**: Anna can take 2, leaving 2 (P-position). Berta then takes 1, and Anna takes the last. N-position.
- **n=5**: Anna takes all 5. N-position.
- **n=6**: Any move leaves an N-position, so n=6 is a P-position.

Continuing this analysis, a pattern emerges where P-positions occur at n = 2^m - 2. For example:
- 2 = 2^2 - 2
- 6 = 2^3 - 2
- 14 = 2^4 - 2
- 30 = 2^5 - 2
- ...

To find the smallest N ≥ 100,000 of this form, we calculate 2^m - 2 ≥ 100,000. Solving for m, we find m=17 gives 2^17 - 2 = 131,070, which is the required answer.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 1: <keep>The rules for removing are a bit specific.</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 2: <keep>If there are n marbles on the table at the start of your turn, you can remove k marbles, where k is at least 1.</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 3: <keep>Additionally, k has to satisfy one of two conditions: either k is an even number that's less than or equal to half of n (k ≤ n/2), or k is an odd number that's between half of n and n, inclusive (n/2 ≤ k ≤ n).</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 1: <keep>We need to determine the smallest number N ≥ 100,000 such that Berta can force a win if the game starts with N marbles.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 2: <keep>So, Berta is the second player here, since Anna goes first.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 1: <keep>This seems like a combinatorial game theory problem where we need to determine the losing positions (positions from which the current player cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally).</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 2: <keep>Since Berta wants to force a win if the starting number is N, we need to find the smallest N ≥ 100,000 that is a losing position.</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 1: <keep>Start with n = 1:</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 2: <keep>Anna's turn. She can remove 1 marble (since k must be odd and 1/2 ≤ 1 ≤ 1). She takes it and wins. So, n=1 is a winning position.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 1: <keep>n=2:</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 2: <keep>Anna's options:</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 3: <keep>Even k: k ≤ 1 (since n=2, n/2 =1). So, k can be 2 but wait, for even k, it must be ≤ n/2. So, n=2, n/2=1, so even k ≤1. The only even number less than or equal to 1 is 0, which is invalid (k must be ≥1). So, no even moves. Therefore, she must take an odd k with n/2=1 ≤k ≤2. The possible odd numbers between 1 and 2 are 1. So, she can take 1 marble.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 4: <keep>Then, Berta has 1 marble left. Berta takes it and wins.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 5: <keep>Therefore, n=2 is a losing position.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 1: <keep>In combinatorial game theory, N-position means the Next player can force a win, while P-position means the Previous player can force a win (i.e., current player cannot).</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 2: <keep>So, yes, n=2 is a P-position because the current player (Anna) can't force a win, so the next player (Berta) can.</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 1: <keep>At n=3:</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 2: <keep>Anna can take 3 marbles (odd, 1.5 ≤3≤3). So take all and win. N-position.</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 1: <keep>n=4:</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 2: <keep>Anna's options:</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 3: <keep>Even k=2 (leaving n=2, P-position).</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 4: <keep>Therefore, Anna can win here.</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 1: <keep>n=6:</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 2: <keep>Anna's possible moves:</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 3: <keep>Even k=2, leaving n=4 (N-position).</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 4: <keep>Odd k=3,5, leaving n=3 or 1 (both N-positions).</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 5: <keep>All moves leave opponent in N-position, so n=6 is a P-position.</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentence 1: <keep>Continuing analysis:</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentence 2: <keep>n=8:</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentence 3: <keep>Anna can take 2 marbles, leaving n=6 (P-position). Therefore, n=8 is N-position.</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 1: <keep>Observing P-positions at n=2,6:</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 2: <keep>Potential pattern: numbers of the form 2^m -2.</keep>
- Paragraph 14, Sentence 1: <keep>Testing hypothesis with n=14:</keep>
- Paragraph 14, Sentence 2: <keep>All moves from n=14 lead to N-positions, confirming P-position.</keep>
- Paragraph 15, Sentence 1: <keep>Generalizing pattern:</keep>
- Paragraph 15, Sentence 2: <keep>P-positions are 2^m -2 (e.g., 2,6,14,30...).</keep>
- Paragraph 16, Sentence 1: <keep>To find N ≥100,000:</keep>
- Paragraph 16, Sentence 2: <keep>Compute 2^m -2 ≥100000. For m=17, 2^17-2=131070.</keep>
- Paragraph 17, Sentence 1: <keep>Conclusion:</keep>
- Paragraph 17, Sentence 2: <keep>The smallest N is 131070.</keep>
