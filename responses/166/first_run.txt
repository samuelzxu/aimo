Okay, so I need to figure out which parts of the reasoning process are essential to keep for future steps. Let's go through each section one by one.

1. **Problem Setup and Initial Thoughts**:
   - The user states the problem and initial thoughts about using the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) or Rolle's Theorem. This is crucial because it sets the direction of the proof.

2. **Manipulating the Equation**:
   - Combining the fractions to get a simplified form. This step shows the algebraic manipulation needed, which might be referenced later.

3. **Considering Integration**:
   - The idea of integrating the right-hand side (RHS) to construct a function. However, recognizing the logarithmic singularities at endpoints is important for understanding why this approach alone isn't sufficient.

4. **Defining Auxiliary Function g(x)**:
   - Introducing g(x) with logarithmic terms. The key here is realizing the singularities at a and b, leading to the need for a different approach.

5. **Re-defining Functions and Checking Endpoints**:
   - Repeated attempts to define functions (h(x), L(x)) and checking their behavior at endpoints. The conclusion that h(a) and h(b) can't be equal unless a = b is a critical realization.

6. **Exploring Cauchy Mean Value Theorem**:
   - Considering alternative theorems but finding them inapplicable. This step narrows down the viable methods.

7. **Returning to Auxiliary Function and Rolle's Theorem**:
   - Defining h(x) = (a - x)(b - x)f(x) and computing its derivative. This part is vital because it leads to the final application of Rolle's theorem despite initial complexities.

8. **Overcoming Singularities with Global Maximum**:
   - Realizing that even with endpoint singularities, the function g(x) must attain a global maximum inside (a, b), applying Fermat's theorem. This is the breakthrough step that solves the problem.

The essential tokens are those that define the auxiliary function g(x), the derivative calculation, and the application of Fermat's theorem. These parts are necessary for understanding how the maximum point leads to the desired derivative expression.

- Paragraph 3, Sentence 1: <keep>So the equation we need is f'(c) = 1/(a - c) + 1/(b - c) + 1/(a + b). Let me first write this as:</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 1: <keep>Hmm, not sure if this helps yet, but maybe if I combine these terms over a common denominator.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 1: <keep>So maybe if I define a function g(x) which is f(x) minus the integral of [1/(a - t) + 1/(b - t) + 1/(a + b)] dt from a to x?</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 1: <keep>Which is: = f'(x) - [1/(a -x)] - [1/(b -x)] - 1/(a + b)</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, g'(x) = f'(x) - 1/(a - x) - 1/(b - x) - 1/(a + b)</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 2: <keep>Therefore, if I can make sure that g(a) and g(b) are equal, then by Rolle's theorem, there exists c in (a, b) such that g'(c)=0, which is exactly what we need.</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 1: <keep>At x =a: g(a) = f(a) + ln(0) + ln(b -a) + a/(a +b) → -∞ + finite terms → -∞</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 2: <keep>At x =b: g(b) = f(b) + ln(a -b) + ln(0) + b/(a + b) → also -∞ + finite terms → -∞</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, this approach is flawed because of the singularities at the endpoints.</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentence 1: <keep>Let me compute the derivative of (a -x)(b -x )f(x ).</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentence 2: <keep>h’(x ) = - (b -x )f(x ) - (a -x )f(x ) + (a -x )(b -x )f’(x )</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 1: <keep>If we want h’(x ) to be something manageable, perhaps adding terms to h(x ) so that h’(x ) gives the equation desired.</keep>
- Paragraph 14, Sentence 1: <keep>So h(a ) = h(b ) =0! So if h is differentiable on (a, b ) and continuous on [a, b ], then by Rolle's theorem, there exists c in (a, b ) such that h’(c )=0.</keep>
- Paragraph 15, Sentence 1: <keep>Hence: f’(c ) = [(a +b -2c )(f(c ) -1 )]/[(a -c )(b -c ) ]</keep>
- Paragraph 17, Sentence 1: <keep>But since f is an arbitrary differentiable function, there is no reason that f(c ) should satisfy this equation.</keep>
- Paragraph 18, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, this approach can't be directly unless the additional terms can be associated to another function's values.</keep>
- Paragraph 19, Sentence 1: <keep>But in reality, g(x ) is not defined at a and b.</keep>
- Paragraph 20, Sentence 1: <keep>Let me compute combining fractions: Let’s compute 1/(1 -t ) +1/(2 -t )= [ (2 -t )+ (1 -t ) ] / ( (1 -t )(2 -t ) )= (3 -2t )/( (1 -t )(2 -t ) )</keep>
- Paragraph 21, Sentence 1: <keep>Hence, the problem is solved by considering such g(x ) and applying Fermat's theorem.</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 3: <keep>But in this case, the expression for f'(c) isn't straightforward; it involves terms with a, b, and c in the denominator.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 2: <keep>So the equation we need is f'(c) = [1/(a - c) + 1/(b - c)] + 1/(a + b)</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 2: <keep>So f'(c) = (a + b - 2c)/[(a - c)(b - c)] + 1/(a + b)</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 1: <keep>But unless the integrals are equal, which would require that f(b ) - f(a ) equals ∫[1/(a -x ) +...]dx from a to b.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 2: <keep>Thus, the total integral is infinity + (b -a)/(a +b ), i.e., infinity.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, this approach is also invalid.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 1: <keep>Thus, the function must attain a global maximum in (a,b ).</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 2: <keep>Hence, by Fermat's theorem, there exists c ∈ (a,b ) whereg’(c )=0.</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, exactly this desired expression: f’(c ) =1/(a -c ) +1/(b -c ) +1/(a +b )</keep>
- Paragraph 1, Sentence 1: <keep>Function  $f: [a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$ ,  $0<a<b$  is continuous on  $[a,b]$  and differentiable on  $(a,b)$ . Prove that there exists  $c\in(a,b)$  such that  \[ f'(c)=\frac1{a-c}+\frac1{b-c}+\frac1{a+b}.  \]</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 1: <keep>First, I know that when you have to prove the existence of a certain derivative (or something related to derivatives), especially with an expression like that, it's likely that we need to use the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) or maybe Rolle's Theorem.</keep>

- Paragraph 3, Sentence 2: <keep>Let me first write this as:</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 1: <keep>Hmm, not sure if this helps yet, but maybe if I combine these terms over a common denominator.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 2: <keep>So:</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 1: <keep>Expand first term:</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 2: <keep>Combine like terms:</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 1: <keep>But the key idea isn't here. Let's maybe pause and think differently.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 1: <keep>We are supposed to find c such that f'(c) - [1/(a -c) + 1/(b -c) + 1/(a + b)] = 0.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 2: <keep>So maybe if I define a function g(x) which is f(x) minus the integral of [1/(a - t) + 1/(b - t) + 1/(a + b)] dt from a to x?</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 1: <keep>Which is: = f'(x) - [1/(x - a)] - [(-1)/(b - x)] - 1/(a + b)</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 2: <keep>But according to the problem statement, we need f'(x) = 1/(a - x) + 1/(b - x) + 1/(a + b).</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, g'(x) = f'(x) - 1/(a - x) - 1/(b - x) - 1/(a + b)</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 2: <keep>Therefore, if we want g(a) and g(b) to be equal, then by Rolle's theorem, there exists c in (a, b) such that g'(c)=0, which is exactly what we need.</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 1: <keep>At x =a: g(a) = f(a) + ln(0) + ln(b -a) + a/(a +b) → -∞</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 2: <keep>At x =b: g(b) = f(b) + ln(a -b) + ln(0) + b/(a + b) → -∞</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 1: <keep>This suggests that defining g(x) in this way might not be feasible because at the endpoints, the function g(x) tends to -infinity.</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentence 1: <keep>Compute the derivative of (a -x)(b -x )f(x ).</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentence 2: <keep>h’(x ) = - (b -x )f(x ) - (a -x )f(x ) + (a -x )(b -x )f’(x )</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 1: <keep>If we set h(a ) = h(b ), then applying Rolle's theorem.</keep>
- Paragraph 14, Sentence 1: <keep>At x =a: h(a )= 0</keep>
- Paragraph 14, Sentence 2: <keep>At x =b: h(b )= 0</keep>
- Paragraph 15, Sentence 1: <keep>Thus, by Rolle's theorem, there exists c in (a, b ) such that h’(c )=0.</keep>
- Paragraph 15, Sentence 2: <keep>Solve for f’(c ):</keep>
- Paragraph 16, Sentence 1: <keep>This becomes: f’(c ) = [(a +b -2c )(f(c ) -1 )]/[(a -c )(b -c ) ]</keep>
- Paragraph 17, Sentence 1: <keep>But since f is an arbitrary differentiable function, there is no reason that f(c ) should satisfy this equation.</keep>
- Paragraph 18, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, this approach is blocked.</keep>
- Paragraph 19, Sentence 1: <keep>Since g(x ) tends to -infty both sides, there must be a point where g(x ) achieves a maximum.</keep>
- Paragraph 20, Sentence 1: <keep>Example: Let’s take a=1, b=2, solve 0=1/(1 -c ) +1/(2 -c ) +1/3.</keep>
- Paragraph 21, Sentence 1: <keep>Thus, even in this specific case, a solution exists in (1,2 ).</keep>
- Paragraph 22, Sentence 1: <keep>Hence, the function g(x ) must achieve a global maximum in (a,b ).</keep>
- Paragraph 22, Sentence 2: <keep>Therefore, by Fermat's theorem, at this maximum point c, g’(c )=0.</keep>
- Paragraph 23, Sentence 1: <keep>Thus, the result is proven.</keep>
- Paragraph 24, Sentence 1: <keep>\boxed{\exists\, c\in(a,b) \text{ such that } f'(c) = \frac{1}{a-c} + \frac{1}{b-c} + \frac{1}{a+b}}</keep>
