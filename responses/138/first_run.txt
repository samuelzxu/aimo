Alright, let's go through the Deepseek Thinking Trajectory and identify the essential tokens that need to be preserved for future reasoning steps. The goal is to highlight the key sentences and phrases that directly contribute to the reasoning process regarding the percentage decrease in baryon mass if chiral symmetry were exact.

1. **Paragraph 2, Sentence 2**: The user begins by connecting chiral symmetry to quark masses and considers the role of binding energy. This sets the foundation for the entire thought process.
   - **Keep**: "First, I remember that chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is related to the masses of quarks. If chiral symmetry were exact, that would mean the quarks are massless, right?"

2. **Paragraph 2, Sentence 4**: This introduces the distinction between current quark masses and binding energy, critical for understanding mass contributions.
   - **Keep**: "So if chiral symmetry were exact (meaning quark masses are zero?), then the mass of the hadrons (like protons and neutrons) would mostly come from where?"

3. **Paragraph 3, Sentence 2**: Explains the Standard Model perspective on proton mass sources, emphasizing binding energy over Higgs contributions.
   - **Keep**: "In the Standard Model, most of the mass of protons and neutrons isn't from the Higgs-generated quark masses but from the binding energy and the gluon fields."

4. **Paragraph 4, Sentences 2-3**: Provides numerical values for quark masses and their contribution to proton mass, key for quantitative analysis.
   - **Keep**: "For the light quarks (up and down), their masses are around a few MeV. The proton's mass is about 938 MeV/c2. The up and down quark masses are about 2-5 MeV each. But there's three quarks in a proton (uud), so adding their masses gives, say, roughly (2+2+5)=9 MeV. But that's like 1% of the proton's mass."

5. **Paragraph 5, Sentence 1**: Highlights the confusion between current and constituent quark masses, a pivotal concept in the analysis.
   - **Keep**: "Wait, perhaps the confusion is between current quark masses and constituent quark masses. Constituent quarks have masses around 300 MeV because of the binding energy and chiral symmetry breaking."

6. **Paragraph 6, Sentences 3-4**: Discusses the role of chiral symmetry breaking in generating constituent quark masses and their impact on baryon mass.
   - **Keep**: "Chiral symmetry breaking is responsible for generating the constituent quark masses. So if we have spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking (which would happen even if the quarks are massless), then the pions are Goldstone bosons."

7. **Paragraph 7, Sentences 1-2**: Breaks down the sources of nucleon mass, crucial for evaluating the impact of chiral symmetry.
   - **Keep**: "The mass of the nucleon comes mainly from three sources: 1. The quark condensate (related to chiral symmetry breaking) 2. The quark masses 3. The trace anomaly (gluon contributions)."

8. **Paragraph 8, Sentence 4**: Introduces the sigma term, a quantitative measure of quark mass contribution to nucleon mass.
   - **Keep**: "The pion-nucleon sigma term is around 50-60 MeV (according to recent lattice calculations). For example, if sigma term is σ ≈ 50 MeV, then that's about 5% of the nucleon mass."

9. **Paragraph 9, Sentences 3-4**: Considers the scenario where chiral symmetry is exact and its impact on constituent quark masses.
   - **Keep**: "If chiral symmetry were exact (so no spontaneous symmetry breaking), then the constituent masses would be much lower? Because constituent mass is due to the cloud of gluons and quark-antiquark pairs, which arises due to chiral symmetry breaking."

10. **Paragraph 10, Sentence 3**: Reiterates the dominant role of QCD dynamics in nucleon mass, a key argument against massive decreases.
    - **Keep**: "The majority of the proton mass arises not from the Higgs mechanism but from the dynamics of QCD, specifically from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry."

11. **Paragraph 11, Sentences 4-5**: Connects the chiral condensate to the proton mass scale, emphasizing theoretical uncertainties.
    - **Keep**: "The chiral condensate is about (250 MeV)^3, so the energy scale associated with chiral symmetry breaking is around 250 MeV. The proton mass is about 1 GeV."

12. **Paragraph 12, Sentences 2-3**: Discusses lattice QCD findings on nucleon mass in the chiral limit, providing empirical context.
    - **Keep**: "According to some models, the nucleon mass in the chiral limit (massless quarks) is about 800-900 MeV, and the physical mass is ~938 MeV. Then the current quark mass contributes about 130 MeV, which is about 13% of the total."

13. **Paragraph 13, Sentence 2**: Explores the hypothesis that chiral symmetry breaking contributes most mass, leading to significant decreases if absent.
    - **Keep**: "If chiral symmetry being exact (unbroken) would lead to the constituent quarks having near-zero mass. Then the baryon made of three constituent quarks would have nearly three times larger current quark mass (which for massless quarks, would be zero)."

14. **Paragraph 14, Sentence 4**: References the sigma term's role in explicit symmetry breaking, tying numerical values to mass contributions.
    - **Keep**: "The sigma term is considered a measure of the explicit chiral symmetry breaking in the nucleon mass. If sigma term is around 50 MeV, then the percentage contribution is about 5%."

15. **Paragraph 15, Sentences 3-4**: Considers the MIT bag model's perspective on mass sources, alternative to constituent quark models.
    - **Keep**: "In the MIT bag model, the mass comes mostly from the bag energy (confinement) and kinetic terms, not the masses of the quarks. So in that model, if quarks are massless, the nucleon mass is still sizable."

16. **Paragraph 16, Sentence 3**: Highlights the ambiguity in relating condensate energy to hadron mass, a critical uncertainty in the reasoning.
    - **Keep**: "The relation between the condensate's value and the hadron masses is not direct."

17. **Paragraph 17, Sentence 2**: Summarizes the initial conclusion regarding quark mass contribution, a baseline for further analysis.
    - **Keep**: "The initial analysis suggested that quark masses contribute about 1%."

18. **Paragraph 18, Sentences 2-3**: Explores the extreme scenario where chiral symmetry restoration eliminates most mass, aligning with high-percentage options.
    - **Keep**: "If the chiral symmetry breaking accounts for ~Σ term which is sigma_πN ≈ 50 MeV in proton mass of 938MeV, then exact symmetry would remove that ~5%, so resulting in a 95% retained and 5% drop."

These selections capture the core arguments, numerical data, and theoretical considerations necessary for evaluating the percentage decrease in baryon mass under exact chiral symmetry.
