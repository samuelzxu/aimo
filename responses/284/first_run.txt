Alright, let me start by understanding the problem. We have a population model where the growth rate depends on the resource level, and the resource is consumed by the population. The goal is to find the time until all resources are depleted.

First, the key equations are the differential equations for the population \( N(t) \) and the resource \( R(t) \):
\[
\frac{dN}{dt} = \alpha R N
\]
\[
\frac{dR}{dt} = -\beta N
\]
with initial conditions \( R(0) = R_0 = 10^6 \) and \( N(0) = N_0 = 1 \).

To solve this system, we can combine the two equations. By dividing them, we eliminate \( dt \):
\[
\frac{dN}{dR} = \frac{\alpha R N}{-\beta N} = -\frac{\alpha}{\beta} R
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
dN = -\frac{\alpha}{\beta} R \, dR
\]
Integrating both sides from the initial conditions to some time \( t \):
\[
N - N_0 = -\frac{\alpha}{2\beta} (R^2 - R_0^2)
\]
So,
\[
N = N_0 + \frac{\alpha}{2\beta} (R_0^2 - R^2)
\]

Next, substitute \( N \) back into the resource equation:
\[
\frac{dR}{dt} = -\beta \left( N_0 + \frac{\alpha}{2\beta} (R_0^2 - R^2) \right)
\]
\[
\frac{dR}{dt} = -\beta N_0 - \frac{\alpha}{2} (R_0^2 - R^2)
\]
Substituting the given values \( \alpha = 10^{-9} \), \( \beta = 1 \), \( R_0 = 10^6 \), \( N_0 = 1 \), this becomes:
\[
\frac{dR}{dt} = -1 - \frac{10^{-9}}{2} (10^{12} - R^2)
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\frac{dR}{dt} = \frac{10^{-9}}{2} R^2 - 501
\]
This is a separable differential equation. Rearranging and integrating:
\[
\int \frac{dR}{\frac{10^{-9}}{2} R^2 - 501} = \int dt
\]
Using partial fractions and integrating, we find the time \( T \) when \( R = 0 \).

After evaluating the integral and substituting the limits, we find that the time \( T \) approximately equals 2.1 hours after converting seconds to hours.

The critical steps involve setting up the differential equations, combining them to find \( N \) in terms of \( R \), substituting back to form a separable ODE, and integrating with partial fractions. The key tokens here are the differential equations, the integration steps, and the final time conversion.
