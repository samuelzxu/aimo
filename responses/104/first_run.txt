Okay, let me try to figure out which parts of the reasoning are essential to keep for solving the problem. The user wants me to mark tokens necessary for future steps. The main goal is to find the sum of the two possible values of c.

First, the polynomial is given as 2x³ - 2ax² + (a² -81)x - c. The roots are positive integers, so the polynomial can be written as 2(x - r)(x - s)(x - t). Expanding this gives relationships between the roots and coefficients:

1. Sum of roots: r + s + t = a
2. Sum of products of roots two at a time: rs + rt + st = (a² -81)/2
3. Product of roots: rst = c/2

Additionally, the sum of squares of the roots must be 81. This comes from the variance formula and substituting the earlier equations. This is a critical point because it constrains the possible roots.

Next, the process of finding all triples (r, s, t) such that their squares sum to 81. The valid triples found are (1,4,8), (3,6,6), and (4,4,7). Each of these triples gives different a and c values:

- (1,4,8): a=13, c=64
- (3,6,6): a=15, c=216
- (4,4,7): a=15, c=224

Since Jon couldn't determine c even after knowing a, the value of a must correspond to multiple c values. Here, a=15 has two c values (216 and 224), so their sum is 440.

The key points to retain are the equations derived from expanding the polynomial, the sum of squares constraint, the valid root triples, and the resulting a and c pairs, especially that a=15 has two c values.
