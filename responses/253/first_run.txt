Okay, I need to figure out which tokens are essential for future reasoning steps in solving this complex number problem. Let me go through the provided reasoning step by step.

First, the problem involves three complex numbers z₁, z₂, z₃ with given magnitudes and an expression involving their products. The goal is to find the magnitude of their sum. The initial reasoning discusses substituting each z with scaled unit complex numbers (w₁, 2w₂, 3w₃) to simplify the given condition.

Key steps include:
1. Substitution to normalize the complex numbers to unit magnitudes.
2. Factoring and manipulating the given expression to relate it to the desired sum.
3. Expanding expressions and using properties of complex numbers' magnitudes.
4. Realizing through algebraic manipulation that the magnitude of the sum must be 2 regardless of specific values due to derived relationships.

The critical parts for retaining would be the substitutions made (z₁ = w₁, z₂ = 2w₂, z₃ = 3w₃), the transformed given condition after substitution, and the algebraic steps that link the given condition to the desired sum's magnitude. Specifically, the expansion of |A|² and |S|², and how combining them leads to |S|=2 is crucial. Any step that establishes a direct mathematical relationship necessary for concluding |S|=2 should be marked as essential.

I'll need to ensure that each marked section includes complete sentences or phrases that capture these critical substitutions, transformations, and algebraic relationships without omitting necessary details. This includes the moment when the problem is restructured using substitutions, key algebraic expansions, and the final deduction step that ties everything together to yield |S|=2.
