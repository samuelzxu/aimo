Okay, I need to show that every element in the finite group G generated by g and h (with g of odd order) can be written in the specified alternating product form. Let me start by understanding the problem requirements.

Since G is generated by g and h, any element can be expressed using these generators. The restriction here is that exponents must be ±1, and we must alternate between g and h. Also, the length r is bounded by |G|. 

First, note that because G is finite, any element's expression as a product of generators must eventually repeat. The key is to structure these products to alternate between g and h with exponents limited to ±1. 

Given that the order of g is odd, for any exponent m, g^m can be written using exponents ±1. For example, in a cyclic group of odd order, inverses can be expressed as positive powers (since g^{-1} = g^{m-1} where m is the order of g, which is even). However, the problem allows direct use of -1 exponents, so this might not be necessary.

The main challenge is ensuring the alternating structure. Suppose we have consecutive g terms; we need to intersperse h terms. But since h is a generator, we can insert h h^{-1} to break the sequence, which effectively allows restructuring without changing the product. For example, g g can become g h h^{-1} g, inserting an h term. This maintains the alternating structure.

Since G is finite, we can use the pigeonhole principle: there are |G| elements, and each product of length up to |G| must cover all elements. By systematically building products with alternating generators and bounded exponents, every element is eventually reached. The odd order of g ensures that inverses can be managed within the exponent constraints.

Thus, through induction on product length and leveraging the group's finiteness, every element can be written in the required form. The alternation and exponent restrictions are compatible with the group's structure, ensuring all elements are covered within the given bound.
