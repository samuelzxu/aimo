Okay, let's start by understanding the problem and the existing reasoning. The user wants me to identify which tokens are essential for future reasoning steps. The original thinking process is quite detailed, so I need to pinpoint the key parts that must be kept to continue the reasoning without losing necessary information.

First, the key formula used is Stress (σ) = E * α * ΔT. The reasoning identifies Young's Modulus (E) for aluminum as 70 GPa, the coefficient of linear expansion (α) as 23 x 10^-6 per °C, and the temperature change (ΔT) as 5.1°C. These values are critical because they are directly used in the stress calculation.

Next, the calculation steps for stress are important. The multiplication of 70, 23, and 5.1 to get 8211, then considering the exponents to get 8.211e6 Pa. This shows how the stress is derived, so keeping these numerical steps is necessary.

Then, converting the cross-sectional area from cm² to m² (20 cm² to 0.002 m²) is crucial because the force calculation requires the area in square meters. The force calculation itself, F = σ * A, resulting in 16,422 N, which converts to 1.6422 x 10^4 N, is vital. The consideration of significant figures here (rounding to two sig figs as 1.6 x 10^4 N) is also key for the final answer.

I need to ensure that all the critical values (E, α, ΔT, area conversion, stress formula, force calculation, and significant figures reasoning) are preserved. The detailed explanations about unit conversions, verification of formulas, and sig figs discussion should be encapsulated to maintain clarity without redundancy.

Now, let me go through each paragraph and sentence to mark the essential tokens with <keep> tags.
