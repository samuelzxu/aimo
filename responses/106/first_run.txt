Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. We need to find the parity of the determinant of a matrix associated with a finite group G. The matrix entries are 0 or 1 depending on whether the product of two group elements (with inverses) commutes in a specific way. Hmm, so first, let's make sure I understand the setup correctly.

The matrix A is defined such that a_{ij} = 0 if x_i x_j^{-1} = x_j x_i^{-1}, and 1 otherwise. We need to determine if det(A) is even or odd. Since the determinant's parity is equivalent to its value modulo 2, maybe there's a pattern or property we can exploit without calculating the determinant directly.

Let's start with small groups to see if we can spot a pattern. For the trivial group (order 1), the matrix is [0], so det(A) = 0, which is even. For Z/2Z, the matrix is all zeros, so determinant 0 again. Next, Z/3Z gives a 3x3 matrix with 0s on the diagonal and 1s elsewhere, which also has determinant 0 modulo 2. So far, all abelian groups yield an even determinant.

What about non-abelian groups? Take S3, the smallest non-abelian group. Constructing the matrix, we notice that some rows end up being identical. For example, rows corresponding to the 3-cycles (123) and (132) are the same. Since identical rows make the determinant zero (mod 2), this suggests the determinant is even here as well.

This pattern holds across abelian and non-abelian examples. The key insight seems to be that the matrix A has structural properties (like duplicated rows or rows summing to zero modulo 2) that force the determinant to be even regardless of the group's specific structure. Thus, the parity of det(A) is always even, leading to the answer 0 modulo 2.
