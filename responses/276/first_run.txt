Okay, I need to figure out where to place the <keep> tags in the provided reasoning trace. Let's start by reading through the problem and the existing solution.

The user provided a question about vectors forming equal angles and their magnitudes. The detailed solution uses coordinate systems and trigonometric identities to find the angle θ and compute the resultant vector's magnitude.

First, the key steps are:

1. Using the formula for the magnitude squared of the sum of vectors.
2. Calculating dot products given equal angles between vectors.
3. Setting up equations based on vector coordinates to find θ.
4. Solving a quadratic equation to find cosθ = -0.5.
5. Verifying with coordinate system examples and computing the final magnitude.

Now, I need to identify which parts of the reasoning are essential for future steps. Important tokens include the formula for |a + b + c|², expressions for dot products in terms of cosθ, derivation leading to cosθ = -0.5, and verification steps confirming the angle and final magnitude.

Looking through each paragraph:

- Paragraphs discussing the formula for |a + b + c|² and expanding it are critical.
- Parts where dot products are related to cosθ should be kept.
- The quadratic equation solving for cosθ and the critical value of -0.5 must be retained.
- The coordinate assignments and verifications that validate the angle and final sum are essential.

Each of these steps builds upon the previous, so missing any key equation or result would hinder further reasoning. However, verbose explanations of vector placements or algebraic manipulations can be condensed if they are standard steps.

I'll go through each paragraph and sentence to mark the essential parts.
