Alright, let's tackle this problem. We need to find all natural numbers \( n \) such that there exist real numbers \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) satisfying the equations:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} x_k = 27
\]
and
\[
\prod_{k=1}^{n} x_k = \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^{24}.
\]

I remember that the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean inequality (AM ≥ GM) could be useful here. For positive real numbers, the AM is always greater than or equal to the GM. So, applying AM-GM to this problem:

The arithmetic mean \( \text{AM} = \frac{27}{n} \).

The geometric mean \( \text{GM} = \left( \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^{24} \right)^{1/n} = \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^{24/n} \).

According to AM ≥ GM, we have:
\[
\frac{27}{n} \geq \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^{24/n}
\]

Raising both sides to the power of \( n \):
\[
\left( \frac{27}{n} \right)^n \geq \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^{24}
\]

Now, we need to find all \( n \) for which this inequality holds. Let's analyze specific values of \( n \):

1. **For \( n = 8 \):**
   \[
   \left( \frac{27}{8} \right)^8 = \left( \frac{3^3}{2^3} \right)^8 = \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^{24} = \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^{24}
   \]
   The equality holds, so \( n = 8 \) is valid.

2. **For \( n = 12 \):**
   \[
   \left( \frac{27}{12} \right)^{12} = \left( \frac{9}{4} \right)^{12} = \left( \frac{3^2}{2^2} \right)^{12} = \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^{24}
   \]
   The equality holds, so \( n = 12 \) is valid.

For \( n = 9, 10, 11 \), we check:
- **\( n = 9 \):** \( \left( \frac{27}{9} \right)^9 = 3^9 = 19683 \) which is greater than \( \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^{24} \approx 16834 \).
- **\( n = 10 \):** \( \left( \frac{27}{10} \right)^{10} \approx 2.7^{10} \approx 20594 \) which is greater.
- **\( n = 11 \):** \( \left( \frac{27}{11} \right)^{11} \approx 2.4545^{11} \approx 19480 \) which is also greater.

For \( n < 8 \) or \( n > 12 \), the values of \( \left( \frac{27}{n} \right)^n \) fall below \( \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^{24} \), making the inequality invalid.

Thus, the system can be solved for \( n \) in the range 8 to 12 inclusive.
