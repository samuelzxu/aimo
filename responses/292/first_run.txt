Okay, let's start by understanding the problem. The question asks which method is NOT relevant for constraining the dark energy equation of state. The options are A, B, C, D.

First, the user provided a detailed thought process. The key points are:

1. **Dark Energy Equation of State**: It's about tracking the universe's expansion history. Methods relevant to this would focus on lower redshifts (z < 2) where dark energy's effect is more pronounced.

2. **Option Analysis**:
   - **A** (Lyman-alpha at z <2): Relevant as it's within the critical redshift range.
   - **B** (CO at 10-20 GHz): Calculations show this corresponds to high z (~4.75-10.5), where dark energy isn't dominant. Hence, not relevant.
   - **C** (21 cm at 600 MHz-1.4 GHz): Redshifts up to ~1.33, relevant.
   - **D** (Galaxy surveys z <2): Directly relevant.

The reasoning hinges on redshift ranges affecting dark energy's detectability. The key points to retain for future steps are:

- **Option B's Frequency to Redshift Conversion**: Explains why it's high z.
- **High Redshift Implications**: Why dark energy isn't dominant there.
- **Conclusion that B is Not Relevant**: The main answer.

So, wrapping these critical parts ensures future steps can verify the redshift calculations and the conclusion's validity without redoing all the analysis.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 3: <keep>The change in frequency would be due to the expansion of the universe (redshift). This is related to the Hubble parameter, which depends on dark energy.</keep>  
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 2: <keep>If the frequency here is between 10-20 GHz, that's a lower frequency, which would mean higher redshift (since observed frequency is lower, implying emission at higher z for a fixed rest frequency).</keep>  
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 6: <keep>Dark energy might not dominate the energy density at such high z.</keep>  
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 1: <keep>If CO intensity mapping is done at 10-20 GHz, which (as my calculation above) would be high redshift (z around 5-10), dark energy's effect on expansion at those epochs is less dominant because dark energy becomes a significant component of the universe's energy density more recently (at lower z).</keep>  
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 3: <keep>Therefore, option B is the one NOT relevant.</keep>  

These selections preserve:  
1. The link between redshift measurements and dark energy constraints.  
2. Critical frequency-to-redshift conversion logic.  
3. The conclusion that high-z CO observations (B) are unsuitable for dark energy constraints.
