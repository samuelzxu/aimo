Okay, so I need to figure out which parts of this long reasoning process are essential to keep for future steps. The problem is about calculating the probability that Ellina's block arrangement is "even," and then finding m + n where the probability is m/n in simplest terms. 

First, let me recall the key points from the thinking process:

1. The definition of an "even" arrangement: each pair of same-colored blocks must have an even number of blocks between them. This translates to each pair being in positions of opposite parity (one even, one odd).
2. The total number of arrangements is 12! / (2^6) because there are two blocks of each color.
3. The favorable arrangements require each color to occupy one even and one odd position. This was calculated as 6! * 6! because each color's positions in even and odd slots can be permuted separately.
4. The probability is then (6! * 6! * 2^6) / 12! which simplifies to 16/231, leading to m + n = 247.

Now, to mark essential tokens:

- The observation that even arrangements require each color to be in opposite parity positions is crucial. This key insight transforms the problem into a combinatorial one involving permutations of even and odd positions.
- The calculation steps where total arrangements and favorable arrangements are derived must be retained. Specifically, the reasoning about how permutations in even and odd positions contribute to the count is vital.
- The simplification process leading to the fraction 16/231 and verification that this is in simplest terms (gcd(16, 231) = 1) is essential for the final answer.

Avoiding redundancy, I should identify sentences that encapsulate these points. For example, the paragraphs where parity reasoning is explained, the key formulas (6! * 6! / (12! / 2^6)), and the final simplification to 16/231 are all critical.

Highlighting the exact sentences or phrases where these insights and calculations occur will ensure that future reasoning steps have the necessary context without unnecessary details. This includes the transformation of the problem into parity consideration, the permutation counts for even and odd positions, the total arrangements formula, and the fraction simplification.
