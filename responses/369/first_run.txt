Alright, I need to figure out which parts of the reasoning are essential to keep for future steps. Let me go through each paragraph and see.

1. **Question Interpretation**: The problem involves two swimmers, Melanie and Sherry, starting from different points on the south bank of a river. They need to reach an equidistant point on the north bank. The river's current affects their paths. The key details here are the river's width (264m), their swimming speeds (80 and 60 m/min), the current speed (14 m/min east), and the distance D between their starting points. These specifics are crucial for setup, so marking them makes sense.

2. **Coordinate System Setup**: Placing Sherry at (0,0) and Melanie at (D,0) establishes their positions. The destination point (D/2, 264) being equidistant is derived here. This conclusion about the midpoint is fundamental for subsequent calculations, so wrapping this part is necessary.

3. **Velocity Components**: The analysis of their velocities relative to water and ground includes equations combining swimming velocity and river current. The breakdown into x (east-west) and y (north) components is essential. The equations for Sherry and Melanie's velocities (v_x, v_y and u_x, u_y) are key and should be kept.

4. **Equation Setup**: The derived equations for Sherry and Melanie's velocities and displacements form the core mathematical model. Specifically, the equations involving (D/(2t) ±14) squared plus (264/t)^2 equal to their speed squares are critical. These equations are solved to find D and t, so they need preservation.

5. **Solving for D/t**: The step where subtracting the two equations eliminates (264/t)^2 and leads to D/t = 100 is pivotal. This relationship directly links D and t, simplifying further calculations. This insight is vital and must be retained.

6. **Substitution and Verification**: Plugging D=100t back into the equations to solve for t (5.5 minutes) and then D (550 meters) is the final computation. Checking with both equations ensures correctness. This verification step confirms the answer's validity and should be kept.

Each of these segments contributes directly to the logical flow and mathematical resolution. Without them, the derivation of D would be unclear or incomplete.
