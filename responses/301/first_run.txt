Okay, let's figure out which parts of the reasoning are essential to keep for future steps. 

First, the problem setup: a point charge near a conducting plate and then adding another plate. The force ratio needs to be found. The key steps here involve understanding the method of images for a single plate and then extending it to two plates. 

For the single plate, the image charge concept is crucial. The original charge induces an image charge, leading to a force calculation. This part is necessary because it establishes the baseline F₀. The calculation steps here should be kept because they form the foundation for comparing F'.

When introducing the second plate, the method of images becomes more complex. The explanation about multiple image charges forming an infinite series is vital. The positions and signs of these image charges determine the total force. The discussion on how each plate's image affects the other and the resulting infinite series must be retained as it's central to calculating F'.

The key mathematical steps involve summing the forces from all image charges. The identification of the series pattern and its relation to Catalan's constant is critical. Even though the exact series sum might be advanced, recognizing that the series converges and its approximation to 0.92 is essential. 

Specific sentences detailing the image charge positions, the force contributions, and the series convergence should be kept. Omitting these would lose the logical flow needed to arrive at the final ratio. The final steps where the ratio is computed using the series sum and rounded must also be preserved to show the conclusion.

Now, I'll mark the essential tokens as instructed.
