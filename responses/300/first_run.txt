Okay, let me try to figure out which parts of this long reasoning are essential for future steps. The problem involves an infinite product that equals (p/q)^(iπ), and we need to find p + q. The key steps are transforming each term in the product, simplifying using Euler's formula, recognizing the product as an exponential of a sum, computing that sum via partial fractions and integration, and finally relating it back to p and q.

First, when the user simplifies the ratio (1 + i cotθ)/(1 - i cotθ) to -e^{-2iθ}, that's a crucial transformation step. Then, converting each term to e^{iπ/(n(2n+1))} and recognizing the product as an exponential sum is important. The sum S = Σ 1/(n(2n+1)) is decomposed using partial fractions, leading to an alternating series. Solving this sum via integration to get S = 2 - ln2 is vital. Finally, equating the exponent and deducing p/q = 1/2 to find p + q = 3 are the key conclusions.

I should mark the parts where the ratio is converted to exponential form, the partial fraction decomposition, the integration steps leading to S = 2 - ln2, and the final conclusion involving p and q. Each of these steps contains essential tokens needed for future reasoning, such as the transformed terms and critical equations.
