Okay, I need to determine which parts of the reasoning are essential to keep for future steps. Let me go through each paragraph and identify the key calculations and data points used to reach the final answer.

Paragraph 1 introduces the problem and the approach using Doppler shift. The key formula Δλ/λ = v/c is mentioned here. Keeping this formula is crucial for understanding the subsequent calculations.

Paragraph 2 discusses calculating the velocity of the Sun due to Jupiter's orbit. The relation M_s * v_s = M_j * v_j is essential here, as it sets up the method to find v_s.

In Paragraph 3, the calculation of Jupiter's orbital velocity (v_j) using 2πa/T is critical. The orbital period and radius values are inputs, but the key formula and the derived velocity (around 13,060 m/s) must be retained.

Paragraph 4 applies the mass ratio (M_j/M_s) to find the Sun's velocity (v_s ≈ 12.5 m/s). This step is vital as it directly impacts the Doppler shift calculation.

Paragraph 5 applies the Doppler formula with v_s = 12.5 m/s. The detailed computation here, especially the final Δλ ≈ 2.7e-5 nm, is the crux leading to the answer.

Repeating these steps in later paragraphs reinforces the calculation, but the key numerical results and formulas are already established. The cross-verification steps confirm the correctness but aren't essential once the result is consistent.

I need to ensure that all critical formulas, key numerical values (masses, velocities), and the final computation steps are marked. This includes the Doppler formula, velocity relation based on masses, Jupiter's velocity calculation, Sun's velocity derivation, and the final Δλ computation. Highlighting these ensures that future reasoning can follow without redoing all steps.
