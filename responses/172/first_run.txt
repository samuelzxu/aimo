Okay, let's break this problem down step by step. We have a rectangle ABCD with AB = 4 and BC = 3. The sides AB and BC are each divided into 168 congruent segments, creating points P_k and Q_k respectively. Segments are drawn between P_k and Q_k for k from 1 to 167. The same construction is done on sides AD and CD, creating segments R_kS_k. Finally, the diagonal AC is drawn. We need to find the sum of all 335 segments.

First, we recognize that each segment P_kQ_k and R_kS_k is parallel to the diagonal AC. The diagonal AC has length 5, as it's the hypotenuse of a 3-4-5 right triangle. 

Next, we determine the length of each segment P_kQ_k. The points P_k divide AB into segments of length 4/168, and Q_k divide BC into segments of length 3/168. The coordinates of P_k are (k/42, 0) and Q_k are (4, 3 - k/56). The vector from P_k to Q_k is (4 - k/42, 3 - k/56), which simplifies to (4(1 - k/168), 3(1 - k/168)). This vector is a scalar multiple of the diagonal AC, scaled by (1 - k/168). Thus, the length of each segment P_kQ_k is 5(1 - k/168).

Since the same logic applies to segments R_kS_k, each segment R_kS_k also has length 5(1 - k/168). There are 167 such segments on each side, plus the diagonal AC. Therefore, the total sum of the lengths is calculated as follows:

1. Sum the lengths of all segments from both sides: 2 * sum_{k=1}^{167} [5(1 - k/168)]
2. Add the length of the diagonal AC (5).

The sum simplifies to 10 * [sum_{k=1}^{167} (1 - k/168)] + 5. Calculating the arithmetic series, we find the total sum is 840.
