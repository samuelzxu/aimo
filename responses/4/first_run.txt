Okay, so I need to figure out which parts of the reasoning are essential to keep for future steps. The user mentioned that I should mark the necessary tokens with <keep> tags. Let me go through each part of the thinking trajectory and see what's crucial.

First, the problem setup: the user has two capacitors in series with given capacitances and uncertainties, and a voltage with uncertainty. They need to find the percentage error in the stored energy. 

The key steps here are the formulas for equivalent capacitance in series (C_eq = (C1*C2)/(C1+C2)), the energy stored ((1/2)*C_eq*V²), and error propagation for each variable. The critical parts would be the error calculations for C1, C2, and V, followed by the error propagation to find ΔC_eq and then combining with the voltage's error to get the total energy error.

Looking at the thinking process, the initial setup of the problem and the formulas are important. Then, the calculations for relative errors of C1 (0.005), C2 (0.005), and V (0.004) are necessary. The derivation of the partial derivatives for ΔC_eq and the subsequent substitution of values to compute ΔC_eq (≈4.327 pF) and its relative error (≈0.36%) are crucial.

Next, combining the relative errors from C_eq and V (since energy depends on C_eq and V²) using the root sum square method: sqrt((0.003606)^2 + (2*0.004)^2) ≈0.008775 or 0.877%. This part is definitely essential as it leads directly to the final answer.

The alternative approach considering maximum/minimum values was a check but ultimately the conclusion was to use error propagation. Since the final answer relies on the error propagation method, those steps where the partial derivatives are calculated and applied are important. The final steps where the total percentage error is computed and rounded to 0.88% are critical as they provide the answer.

So I need to ensure that the sections where formulas are applied, relative errors are calculated, partial derivatives are derived, and the final error combination happens are marked. Also, the final answer conclusion should be included. Specific sentences and equations that form the backbone of the calculation must be kept.

I should look for paragraphs where these key calculations and derivations occur. Each formula application, substitution of values, and error combination steps need to be marked. The cross-verification with max/min values might not be essential for future steps, as the error propagation method is the main approach, so those parts can be excluded from the keep tags.

By identifying these critical sections, I can ensure that the essential reasoning steps required to arrive at the percentage error are preserved without unnecessary details.
