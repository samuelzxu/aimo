Okay, let me figure out where to place the <keep> tags in the existing reasoning. The user wants to identify which tokens are essential for future reasoning steps. 

First, the user recalls the definition of entangled states and the separability condition. The key part here is the condition ad = bc for separability. That's important because it's the main test used for each state. So that explanation needs to be kept.

Then, each state is analyzed individually. For state (a), the coefficients are given, and ad and bc are calculated. Since they aren't equal, it's entangled. These calculations must be retained.

State (b) shows that ad equals bc, making it separable. The specific numbers here are crucial for verifying the result, so they should be kept.

For state (c), the calculations show ad ≠ bc, so it's entangled. The numbers here are also important.

State (d) initially seems similar but ends up separable. The detailed breakdown where they factor the state confirms it's separable. This part is vital for cross-verification.

The conclusion compares all results against the answer choices, highlighting that (B) is correct. Each step of elimination here is necessary for the final answer.

I need to make sure all critical calculations, conditions, and cross-verifications are marked. Also, avoid including too much repetitive explanation. Let me check each paragraph and sentence for these elements.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 3: <keep>if I can write the state as a tensor product of two single-qubit states, then it's not entangled (separable), otherwise, it is entangled.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 1: <keep>for a two-qubit state like a|00> + b|01> + c|10> + d|11>, it's separable if and only if ad = bc.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 6: <keep>Then, ad = αγ * βδ = αβγδ and bc = αδ * βγ = αβγδ. Therefore, ad = bc. So the necessary and sufficient condition for separability is that ad = bc.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 3: <keep>a = 1, b = 2i, c = -3, d = -4i</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 5: <keep>Compute ad: a*d = 1*(-4i) = -4i</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 6: <keep>Compute bc: b*c = (2i)*(-3) = -6i</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 7: <keep>Compare ad vs bc: -4i vs -6i. Not equal. Therefore, state (a) is entangled.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 3: <keep>a = 1, b = 2i, c = -2, d = -4i</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 5: <keep>Compute ad: 1*(-4i) = -4i</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 6: <keep>Compute bc: (2i)*(-2) = -4i</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 7: <keep>So ad = bc. Hence, state (b) is separable. Therefore, not entangled.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 3: <keep>a = 1, b = 1, c = 1, d = -1</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 5: <keep>Compute ad = 1*(-1) = -1</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 6: <keep>Compute bc = 1*1 = 1</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 7: <keep>-1 vs 1: Not equal. Therefore, entangled. Thus, state (c) is entangled.</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 3: <keep>a = 1, b =1, c = -1, d = -1</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 5: <keep>Compute ad = 1*(-1) = -1</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 6: <keep>Compute bc = 1*(-1) = -1</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 7: <keep>Here, ad = bc = -1. Therefore, separable. Hence, state (d) is NOT entangled.</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 1: <keep>So conclusions: (a) is entangled. (b) is not entangled. (c) is entangled. (d) is not entangled.</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 3: <keep>Therefore, the answer should be (B) a,c. So choice (B) is correct.</keep>
- Paragraph 16, Sentence 1: <keep>Multiply these two: (1/(2x)|0> -1/(2x)|1>) ⊗ (x|0> +x|1> )</keep>
- Paragraph 16, Sentence 2: <keep>= (1/2)|00> + 1/2|01> -1/2|10> -1/2|11></keep>
- Paragraph 16, Sentence 3: <keep>Which is exactly the state (d) multiplied by 1/2.</keep>
- Paragraph 17, Sentence 1: <keep>Hence, again, my previous conclusion holds.</keep>
