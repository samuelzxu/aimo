Here are the essential tokens to retain for future reasoning steps:

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 2: <keep>the mean molecular speed formula is sqrt(8kT/(πm))</keep>

- Paragraph 3, Sentence 1: <keep>m is the mass of a hydrogen molecule. Each H2 molecule has two hydrogen atoms, molar mass approximately 2.016 g/mol. Convert to kg: m = (2.016e-3 kg/mol) / Avogadro's number</keep>

- Paragraph 4, Sentence 2: <keep>m ≈ 3.347e-27 kg</keep>

- Paragraph 5, Sentence 2: <keep>alternative formula using gas constant: sqrt(8RT/(πM)), where M is molar mass (0.002016 kg/mol) and R = 8.314 J/(mol·K)</keep>

- Paragraph 7, Sentence 1: <keep>Assuming STP (273.15 K), calculation steps: v_mean = sqrt(8 * 8.314 * 273.15 / (π * 0.002016))</keep>

- Paragraph 7, Sentence 3: <keep>18,168.7768 J/mol divided by π * 0.002016 kg/mol gives 2,869,000 m²/s², sqrt ≈ 1,694 m/s</keep>

- Paragraph 9, Sentence 1: <keep>At 298 K, calculated mean speed ≈ 1,770 m/s</keep>

- Paragraph 11, Sentence 1: <keep>Final assumption of STP (273.15 K) yields approximately 1,694 m/s</keep>

These selected blocks preserve the core formulas, mass calculations, temperature assumptions, and critical computation steps needed to verify or extend the reasoning process while removing redundant details.
