Alright, let's break down the problem step by step. The user is asking for the smallest positive value of \( a \) such that the line \( y = ax \) contains the center of a circle that's externally tangent to \( w_2 \) and internally tangent to \( w_1 \). Then, they need \( m^2 = \frac{p}{q} \) with \( p \) and \( q \) coprime, and finally, \( p + q \).

First, I need to find the centers and radii of the given circles \( w_1 \) and \( w_2 \). Rewriting their equations in standard form by completing the square:

For \( w_1: x^2 + y^2 + 10x - 24y - 87 = 0 \):
- Completing the square for \( x \) gives \( (x + 5)^2 \).
- For \( y \), it's \( (y - 12)^2 \).
- The equation becomes \( (x + 5)^2 + (y - 12)^2 = 256 \), so center \( (-5, 12) \) and radius 16.

For \( w_2: x^2 + y^2 - 10x - 24y + 153 = 0 \):
- Completing the square for \( x \) gives \( (x - 5)^2 \).
- For \( y \), it's \( (y - 12)^2 \).
- The equation becomes \( (x - 5)^2 + (y - 12)^2 = 16 \), so center \( (5, 12) \) and radius 4.

Next, consider a circle with center \( (h, k) \) on \( y = ax \) (so \( k = ah \)) that's externally tangent to \( w_2 \) and internally tangent to \( w_1 \). The distance conditions give:
1. \( \sqrt{(h - 5)^2 + (k - 12)^2} = r + 4 \) (external tangent to \( w_2 \))
2. \( \sqrt{(h + 5)^2 + (k - 12)^2} = 16 - r \) (internal tangent to \( w_1 \))

Subtracting these equations to eliminate \( r \), we find \( h = 12 - 2r \). Substituting \( k = ah \) into the equations and expanding leads to a quadratic in \( r \). The discriminant of this quadratic must be zero for a unique solution (tangency condition), leading to \( a^2 = \frac{69}{100} \). Thus, \( p = 69 \), \( q = 100 \), and \( p + q = 169 \).

Key steps involve completing the square to find circle properties, setting up distance equations, manipulating them to find relationships between variables, and solving the quadratic's discriminant condition. The final answer is verified by considering the ellipse formed by the locus of centers and finding the tangent line with the smallest slope, confirming the result.
