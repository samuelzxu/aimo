Okay, so there's this problem about n people sitting around a circular table, each being either truthful or a liar. Every minute, everyone is asked about their left neighbor's status (truthful or liar), and then they become the same type as their answer. The question asks: what's the largest n (with n ≤ 99) such that no matter who starts as truthful, eventually everyone becomes truthful forever.

Hmm. Let's try to break this down. First, understanding the process. Each person, when asked about their left neighbor, will answer either "truthful" or "liar." Then, after answering, they become the type that matches their answer. So, if a truthful person says their left neighbor is truthful, they remain truthful; if they say the neighbor is a liar, they become a liar. Similarly for a liar: if a liar is asked about their left neighbor, they'll lie, so if the left neighbor is truthful, the liar will answer "liar," and then become a liar themselves. Wait, hold on. If a liar is asked, their answer is a lie, so if the left neighbor is truthful, the liar would lie and say "liar," but then they become the same as their answer, which would be a liar. Hmm, maybe not changing? Wait, no.

Wait, actually, everyone answers the question about their left neighbor. Then, after answering, they "become the same type of person as his answer." That could be a bit ambiguous, but probably, if your answer is "truthful," you become truthful; if your answer is "liar," you become a liar. So regardless of whether you were previously truthful or a liar, after answering, your new type is determined by your answer.

So, how does this work? Let's think about individuals.

Suppose person A is asked about their left neighbor, person B.

Case 1: A is truthful. Then, A truthfully reports B's status. Then, A becomes whatever they answered. Wait, if they're truthful, then their answer already matches their current status. So if B is truthful, A says truthful and remains truthful. If B is a liar, A says liar and becomes a liar.

Case 2: A is a liar. Then, A lies about B's status. So if B is truthful, A says liar, then becomes a liar. If B is a liar, A says truthful, then becomes truthful.

Wait, so in some cases, people switch types, in some cases they stay the same. Let's look at when that happens.

If A is truthful:

- If B is truthful: A answers "truthful" and stays truthful.
- If B is liar: A answers "liar" and becomes a liar.

If A is a liar:

- If B is truthful: A lies, says "liar," and becomes a liar.
- If B is liar: A lies, says "truthful," and becomes truthful.

Therefore, for a person A, their next state depends on both their current state and the state of their left neighbor.

Let me see:

Let’s model the state transition for person A. Let T denote truthful, L denote liar. The left neighbor is person B.

If A is T:

- A tells the truth about B. Then, A's next state is T if B is T, else L if B is L.

If A is L:

- A lies about B. Then, A's next state is T if B is L (since A lies about B being L, which would mean B is actually T; but since A is lying, if B is L, A would say T, so A's next state is T), or L if B is T (since A would lie about B being T, meaning B is actually L, so A's next state is L). Wait, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, maybe better to model the transitions as:

For a person A at time t:

Let S_A(t) be the state of A (T or L) at time t.

Then, their answer Q_A(t) is:

If S_A(t) = T, then Q_A(t) = S_B(t) (truthful answer about B)
If S_A(t) = L, then Q_A(t) = ¬S_B(t) (lie about B)

Then, S_A(t+1) = Q_A(t)

Therefore, S_A(t+1) = S_B(t) if S_A(t) = T
              = ¬S_B(t) if S_A(t) = L

Therefore, combining these:

S_A(t+1) = (S_A(t) ? S_B(t) : ¬S_B(t))

Hmm, which can be written compactly as:

S_A(t+1) = S_B(t) XOR S_A(t)'

Wait, that is, if A is truthful (S_A(t)=T), then S_A(t+1)=S_B(t). If A is lying, S_A(t+1)= ¬S_B(t). So in propositional logic terms, S_A(t+1) = (S_A(t) ∧ S_B(t)) ∨ (¬S_A(t) ∧ ¬S_B(t)), which is equivalent to (S_A(t) ↔ S_B(t)).

Wait, actually, since S_A(t+1) is S_B(t) if A is truthful, else ¬S_B(t). So:

S_A(t+1) = (S_A(t) → S_B(t)) ∧ (¬S_A(t) → ¬S_B(t))), which is S_A(t) ↔ S_B(t). So actually, S_A(t+1) is equivalent to the XNOR of S_A(t) and S_B(t), which is the same as S_A(t) ↔ S_B(t). Hmm, so this would be equivalent to (S_A(t) ∧ S_B(t)) ∨ (¬S_A(t) ∧ ¬S_B(t)). But how does that help?

Alternatively, we can see this as S_A(t+1) = (S_A(t) ∧ S_B(t)) ∨ (¬S_A(t) ∧ ¬S_B(t)), which is the XNOR operation, but in terms of progression over time. So each person's next state is equal to the XNOR of their current state and their left neighbor's current state.

Wait, if we consider truth values as booleans, say T=1, L=0, then:

S_A(t+1) = (S_A(t) ∧ S_B(t)) ∨ (¬S_A(t) ∧ ¬S_B(t)) = (S_A(t) XNOR S_B(t))

But more importantly, perhaps express this as a linear function over some field. But maybe thinking in modulo arithmetic, XOR operations. Wait, if XNOR is equivalent to XOR plus 1, so S_A(t+1) = 1 - (S_A(t) XOR S_B(t)). So, in terms of mod 2:

If we represent T as 1 and L as 0, then:

S_A(t+1) = 1 - (S_A(t) + S_B(t)) mod 2

Hmm, I need to check that. Let me tabulate all possibilities.

S_A(t) | S_B(t) | S_A(t+1)

0 (L) | 0 (L) | 1 - (0 + 0) mod 2 = 1 (T)

0 (L) | 1 (T) | 1 - (0 + 1) mod 2 = 1 - 1 = 0 (L)

1 (T) | 0 (L) | 1 - (1 + 0) mod 2 = 0 (L)

1 (T) | 1 (T) | 1 - (1 + 1) mod 2 = 1 - 0 = 1 (T)

Wait, but this conflicts with our previous analysis. For example, if A is T (1) and B is L (0), then S_A(t+1) should be L (0), which matches. If A is L (0) and B is L (0), then S_A(t+1) is T (1). But according to the previous logical analysis, if A is L (0) and B is L (0), since A lies about B, A would say B is T (1), so A becomes T (1). That matches. Similarly, if A is L (0) and B is T (1), then A lies about B and says B is L (0), so A becomes L (0). Which matches.

So in general, the formula S_A(t+1) = 1 - (S_A(t) + S_B(t) mod 2) is correct. So, in modulo 2 arithmetic:

S_A(t+1) = 1 - (S_A(t) + S_B(t)) mod 2

Alternatively, since 1 - x mod 2 is equivalent to (1 + x) mod 2, because -x ≡ 1 - x mod 2 when x is 0 or 1.

But 1 - (S_A + S_B) mod 2 is equivalent to (1 - S_A - S_B) mod 2. But subtraction mod 2 is the same as addition. But maybe an alternative way to represent.

But maybe it's better to reorganize the equation.

We can write S_A(t+1) = (1 - S_A(t) - S_B(t)) mod 2. But perhaps also flip signs if we use T=1 and L=0.

Alternatively, since in mod 2:

S_A(t+1) = 1 + S_A(t) + S_B(t), because 1 - S_A(t) - S_B(t) = 1 + (-1)*(S_A(t) + S_B(t)). But in mod 2, -1 ≡ 1, so it's 1 + S_A(t) + S_B(t) mod 2.

Hence, S_A(t+1) ≡ 1 + S_A(t) + S_B(t) mod 2

Alternatively, given that for the next state, each S_A(t+1) is 1 + S_A(t) + S_B(t) mod 2.

Wait, but we can check:

If S_A(t)=0 and S_B(t)=0, then 1 + 0 + 0 =1 mod 2, which is T.

If S_A(t)=0, S_B(t)=1: 1 + 0 +1= 2 ≡0 mod 2

If S_A(t)=1, S_B(t)=0:1 +1 +0=2≡0 mod2

If S_A(t)=1, S_B(t)=1:1 +1 +1=3≡1 mod2

Which matches the truth table above. So yes, S_A(t+1) ≡ 1 + S_A(t) + S_B(t) mod2.

But this seems similar to a linear transformation. If we could model the entire system as a linear transformation over the vector space (Z/2Z)^n, then we can think of the state evolution as a linear dynamical system.

But the problem is that each person's next state depends on their current state and their left neighbor's current state. So this is a linear recurrence relation?

Given that S(t+1) = M * S(t) + c, where M is a matrix and c is a constant vector. But in this case, since the formula is S_A(t+1) ≡ 1 + S_A(t) + S_B(t) mod2 for each A, with B being the left neighbor of A, this is an affine linear transformation.

However, the 1 makes it affine. So the system is linear if we consider the state in (Z/2Z)^n and the update rule is S(t+1) = M * S(t) + d, where M is a circulant matrix with 1s on the diagonal and 1s on the superdiagonal (assuming left neighbor corresponds to the next index), and d is the all-ones vector. Wait, let's index the people from 0 to n-1, and person i's left neighbor is person (i+1) mod n.

Wait, in the problem statement, the left neighbor of a person A is the person to their immediate left. So if they are sitting in a circle, then each person's left neighbor would be, say, the previous person in the ordering. Let's suppose we have people numbered 0, 1, ..., n-1 arranged clockwise. Then, person i's left neighbor is person (i-1) mod n. So in the case of person 0, their left neighbor is person n-1.

But in the dynamics, when person i is answering about their left neighbor, which is person (i-1) mod n. So their next state is 1 + S_i(t) + S_{(i-1) mod n}(t) mod2.

Wait, is this the case? Let me confirm.

In the formula we derived earlier, S_A(t+1) ≡ 1 + S_A(t) + S_B(t) mod2, where B is A's left neighbor. So if person i's left neighbor is person (i-1) mod n, then:

S_i(t+1) ≡ 1 + S_i(t) + S_{i-1}(t) mod2

Therefore, the entire system can be written as:

S(t+1) ≡ M * S(t) + D mod2

Where M is a matrix with 1s on the diagonal and 1s on the subdiagonal (since each S_i(t+1) is dependent on S_i(t) and S_{i-1}(t)), and D is a vector of all 1s.

Wait, but each component of S(t+1) is 1 + S_i(t) + S_{i-1}(t) mod2. So the matrix M has 1s on the diagonal and 1s on the subdiagonal, and it's a circulant matrix (so the first subdiagonal entry in the last row wraps around to the first column).

So in other words, the state vector S(t+1) is equal to (M * S(t) + D) mod2, where M is a circulant matrix with first row [1, 1, 0, ..., 0], since each row i has 1s in columns i and i-1 (mod n). And D is the all-ones vector.

But since we're working modulo 2, the system is affine linear. However, note that the constant term D is just adding 1 to each component, i.e., D = (1, 1, ..., 1)^T.

If we could make a coordinate transformation to eliminate the constant term, that would simplify the analysis. Let's try that. Let’s define T(t) = S(t) + c, where c is a constant vector to be determined such that the system becomes linear.

So, substituting into the equation:

T(t+1) = S(t+1) + c = M*S(t) + D + c = M*(T(t) - c) + D + c

= M*T(t) - M*c + D + c

If we choose c such that -M*c + D + c ≡ 0 mod2, then T(t+1) = M*T(t).

Thus, the condition is:

(-M*c + D + c) ≡ 0 mod2

Which is equivalent to:

(I - M)*c ≡ D mod2

Where I is the identity matrix.

If (I - M) is invertible mod2, then c = (I - M)^{-1} D mod2.

But invertibility depends on the determinant. However, solving (I - M)*c ≡ D might not always be possible.

But if it's possible, then we can write T(t+1) = M*T(t), which is a linear system.

However, given that n is the number of people, maybe if n is even or odd, different things happen. Alternatively, if the problem requires that regardless of initial state, eventually everyone becomes truthful, which would correspond to all 1s in the S(t) vector, i.e., all T.

Given that this transformation needs to happen regardless of the initial state, it's necessary that the system converges to the all-ones vector from any starting vector.

But in modulo 2 linear algebra, the behavior can be quite structured. For the system S(t+1) = M*S(t) + D mod2, but after a coordinate change, maybe T(t+1) = M*T(t) mod2. Linear systems over finite fields can have periodic behavior, but depending on the eigenvalues of M, etc. If the system is nilpotent, then it might collapse to zero. But here we want the system to converge to a fixed point.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has some periodicity or eventually becomes all ones.

But the problem says "at some point everyone will become truthful forever." So the system reaches the all-ones vector, and once it's there, it stays there. So the fixed point is all ones. Let's check.

Suppose S(t) is all ones, i.e., everyone is truthful. Then, next state S(t+1): for each person i:

S_i(t+1) = 1 + 1 + 1 ≡ 1 + 1 +1 = 3 ≡1 mod2. So everyone stays truthful. So all ones is a fixed point.

Another fixed point: suppose S(t) is all zeros. Then S_i(t+1) = 1 +0 +0=1 mod2. So after one step, it becomes all ones. Wait, all zeros is not a fixed point.

But if you start with all zeros (all liars), then next step is all ones. Then, as we saw, all ones is a fixed point. So the system converges to all ones in two steps?

Wait, no. Starting with all zeros:

At t=0: all zeros.

At t=1: all ones.

At t=2: since all are ones, each S_i(2) = 1 +1 +1=1 mod2. So stays all ones.

So, if you start with all zeros, it converges to all ones in one step.

But, what about starting with a mixture? Suppose half are truthful and half are liars. Let's take n even.

But perhaps the key is to analyze the system's dynamics. Let's try with small n first to get a sense.

Let's start with n=1. There's only one person, who is asked about their left neighbor, which is themselves since it's a circle. Wait, but in a circular table with one person, do they have a left neighbor? If n=1, the left neighbor of person 0 is person 0. So they are their own left neighbor.

Interesting. So for n=1:

S_0(t+1) = 1 + S_0(t) + S_0(t) mod2 = 1 + 2*S_0(t) mod2 = 1 +0=1 mod2. So regardless of S_0(t), the next state is 1. So if n=1, then after one step, the single person becomes truthful forever, regardless of initial state. So for n=1, it works.

Wait, this contradicts the problem statement, which says n≤99. Maybe n=1 is okay.

Wait, the answer must be among 99, so need to check highest n such that the system works. Let's check other n.

For n=2: people 0 and 1, each with left neighbor 1 and 0 respectively.

The update rules are:

S_0(t+1) = 1 + S_0(t) + S_1(t) mod2

S_1(t+1) = 1 + S_1(t) + S_0(t) mod2

So the system is symmetric. Let's see.

Suppose we start with S(0) = [0, 0]. Then S(1) = [1,1], which is fixed. If S(0) = [1,0]:

Compute S_0(1) = 1 +1 +0=0 mod2

S_1(1) = 1 +0 +1=0 mod2

Thus, S(1)=[0,0], then S(2)=[1,1]. So alternates between [0,0] and [1,1]. Wait, but we want that no matter the initial state, it eventually becomes all ones forever. But here, if you start with [1,0], it alternates [0,0] and [1,1], so period 2. Therefore, for n=2, it doesn't satisfy the problem's condition because there is an initial state that leads to periodic behavior, never settling. Wait, but according to the problem statement, "no matter who are the truthful people in the beginning, at some point everyone will become truthful forever." So, in this case, if starting with [1,0] it alternates between [0,0] and [1,1]. But in reality, when you reach [1,1], which is all truthful, you stay there forever, right? Wait, no. When you have [1,1], the next state is [1+1+1=3≡1 mod2, same], correct. Wait, so if you reach [1,1], you stay at [1,1]. So starting from [1,0], next is [0,0], then next is [1,1], then stays there. So even for n=2, after two steps, you reach all ones. But hang on, when S(t)=[1,0], next is [1+1+0=2≡0, and 1+0+1=2≡0, so next state [0,0]. Then from [0,0], next state [1,1], then from [1,1], remains [1,1]. So actually, after two steps from [1,0], you reach [1,1]. Then stays there.

Wait, so in that case, even for n=2, regardless of initial state, you get to [1,1] in finite steps. For [1,1], you stay. For [0,0], you get to [1,1] in one step. For [1,0], you get to [0,0] in one step, then to [1,1]. So regardless of the initial state, after some steps, you get to [1,1]. So in n=2, it works. But is that true?

Wait, let's test another initial state for n=2. For example, start with [1,1]. It stays. Start with [0,1]:

S_0(t+1)=1 +0 +1=0

S_1(t+1)=1 +1 +0=0

Then next state [0,0], then [1,1].

Similarly, regardless of the initial state, the cycle is [1,1] --> [1,1], and all other states go to [0,0] or [1,0], and then eventually to [0,0], which leads to [1,1]. Therefore, perhaps even n=2, it works.

But wait, what about n=3.

For n=3, people 0,1,2, each left neighbor is previous one.

The update rules:

S_0(t+1)=1 + S_0(t) + S_{2}(t) mod2 (since left neighbor of 0 is 2)
S_1(t+1)=1 + S_1(t) + S_0(t) mod2
S_2(t+1)=1 + S_2(t) + S_1(t) mod2

Let me analyze this.

Let me start with some initial state. For example, [0,0,0].

Then next state:

S_0=1+0+0=1

S_1=1+0+0=1

S_2=1+0+0=1

So [1,1,1], fixed. If start with [1,1,1], stay there.

Another example, start with [1,0,0].

Compute next state:

S0=1 +1 +0=0

S1=1 +0 +1=0

S2=1 +0 +0=1

So [0,0,1]

Next step:

S0=1 +0 +1=0 mod2?

Wait:

S0=1 + current S0 (now 0) + current S2 (1): 1 +0 +1=2≡0

Wait, no, confused. Wait, each time, the next state is 1 + old S_i + old S_{i-1}.

Wait, let's take S(t) = [0,0,1].

S0(t+1)=1 + S0(t) + S2(t) =1+0+1=0

S1(t+1)=1 + S1(t) + S0(t)=1+0+0=1

S2(t+1)=1 + S2(t) + S1(t)=1+1+0=0

Thus next state [0,1,0]

Then next:

S0=1 +0 +0=1

Wait, in this example:

Starting with [0,0,1]:

Next state is S0:1 +0 +1=0; S1:1 +0 +0=1; S2:1 +1 +0=0; so [0,1,0]

Then next:

S0:1 +0 +0=1

S1:1 +1 +0=0

S2:1 +0 +1=0

So [1,0,0]

Next:

S0:1 +1 +0=0, S1:1 +0 +1=0, S2:1 +0 +0=1; [0,0,1]

Ah, we enter a cycle: [0,0,1] --> [0,1,0] --> [1,0,0] --> [0,0,1], etc.

Therefore, with n=3, there exists an initial state (like [0,0,1]) that cycles and never reaches all ones. Thus, for n=3, the problem condition is not satisfied because there's a starting configuration that leads to a cyclic behavior and never stabilizes to all truthful. Therefore, n=3 doesn't work.

But n=1,2 work. Let's see n=4.

For n=4, let's see.

First, the update rules:

Person 0: left neighbor 3

Person 1: left neighbor 0

Person 2: left neighbor 1

Person 3: left neighbor 2

So,

S0(t+1) =1 + S0(t) + S3(t)

S1(t+1)=1 + S1(t)+ S0(t)

S2(t+1)=1 + S2(t)+ S1(t)

S3(t+1)=1 + S3(t)+ S2(t)

Let’s analyze for an initial state that isn't all zeros or all ones. Let's try [1,0,0,0].

Step by step:

At t=0: [1,0,0,0]

Compute t=1:

S0:1 +1 +0=0

S1:1 +0 +1=0

S2:1 +0 +0=1

S3:1 +0 +0=1

So [0,0,1,1]

t=1: [0,0,1,1]

Compute t=2:

S0:1 +0 +1=0

S1:1 +0 +0=1

S2:1 +1 +0=0

S3:1 +1 +1=1

[0,1,0,1]

t=2: [0,1,0,1]

Compute t=3:

S0:1 +0 +1=0

S1:1 +1 +0=0

S2:1 +0 +1=0

S3:1 +1 +0=0

[0,0,0,0]

t=3: [0,0,0,0]

Computing t=4:

All next states are 1 +0 +0=1, so [1,1,1,1], fixed. Therefore, from [1,0,0,0], after four steps, it converges to all ones. Let's try another initial state.

Take [1,1,0,0].

t=0: [1,1,0,0]

Compute t=1:

S0:1 +1 +0=0

S1:1 +1 +1=1

S2:1 +0 +1=0

S3:1 +0 +0=1

[0,1,0,1]

Then t=2 as above: leads to [0,0,0,0] in t=3, then all ones at t=4. Hmm. So perhaps, for n=4, even though there are longer transients, still all initial states converge to all ones. Is that true?

Let's test another initial state. Suppose [1,0,1,0]

Compute t=1:

S0=1 +1 +0=0

S1=1 +0 +1=0

S2=1 +1 +0=0

S3=1 +0 +1=0

t=1: [0,0,0,0], then t=2: all ones.

So starting from [1,0,1,0], it converges in two steps.

Wait, is there any cycle that doesn't reach all ones? For n=4, after trying several initial states, they all lead to [1,1,1,1]. Maybe n=4 is okay.

Wait, but let me try one more. Starting with [1,0,1,1]

t=0: [1,0,1,1]

Compute t=1:

S0=1 +1 +1=1 (mod2=1-1=0? Wait, no:

Wait, the formula is S_i(t+1)=1 + S_i(t) + S_{i-1}(t) mod2.

Person0:1 + S0 + S3=>1 +1 +1=3≡1 mod2

Person1:1 + S1 + S0=>1 +0 +1=2≡0 mod2

Person2:1 + S2 + S1=>1 +1 +0=2≡0 mod2

Person3:1 + S3 + S2=>1 +1 +1=3≡1 mod2

So t=1: [1,0,0,1]

Compute t=2:

S0=1 +1 +1=3≡1

S1=1 +0 +1=2≡0

S2=1 +0 +0=1≡1

S3=1 +1 +0=2≡0

t=2: [1,0,1,0]

t=3: S0=1 +1 +0=0; S1=1 +0 +1=0; S2=1 +1 +0=0; S3=1 +0 +1=0 → [0,0,0,0]

t=4: [1,1,1,1]. So again converges.

Another test starting from [1,1,0,1].

t=0: [1,1,0,1]

t=1:

S0=1 +1 +1=1→1+1+1=3≡1

S1=1 +1 +1=3≡1

S2=1 +0 +1=2≡0

S3=1 +1 +0=2≡0

t=1: [1,1,0,0]

t=2:

S0=1 +1 +0=0

S1=1 +1 +1=1

S2=1 +0 +1=0

S3=1 +0 +0=1

t=2: [0,1,0,1]

t=3: [0,0,0,0]

t=4: [1,1,1,1]

Therefore, all initial states for n=4 seem to eventually reach all ones. Therefore, maybe n=4 works.

But according to our prior example with n=3, starting from certain states, it cycles. So the conjecture is that even n work? Or powers of two?

Wait, n=1=2^0, n=2=2^1, n=4=2^2, all work, perhaps 8,16,32,64? The problem is asking for n ≤99, so 64 would be such a power. But need to see whether that's the case.

Alternatively, try n=5. For n=5, likely will cycle.

Let’s take n=3. Cycle as before. n=5 likely the same.

But let's verify with n=4. Suppose I start with an initial state that cycles? From previous examples, even starting with an initial state like [1,0,0,1], which transitions to [1,0,1,0], then [0,0,0,0], then to all ones. So no cycles beyond convergence.

Thus, perhaps if n is a power of two, the system's linear transformation has the property that after several iterations, it collapses to the all-ones state. However, when n is not a power of two, say n=3 or 5, cycles can form.

Therefore, possibly the answer is the largest power of two less than or equal to 99. 2^6=64, 2^7=128 which is >99, so 64.

But we need to confirm this. To test whether generally, if n is a power of two, this happens, otherwise, cycles.

Wait, but how to relate n being a power of two with this system converging? The key idea might be that in the linear algebraic model over GF(2), the transformation matrix (I - M) is invertible if and only if n is a power of two, or related to the order of the transformation. Alternatively, the transformation corresponding to M has an order that divides 2^k for some k such that after sufficient iterations, it becomes the identity.

Alternatively, this could relate to the properties of linear recurring sequences or linear feedback shift registers.

Alternatively, since the system is S(t+1) = M * S(t) + D mod2, then after multiple steps, S(t) = M^t * S(0) + (M^{t-1} + M^{t-2} + ... + I )* D mod2. If we can show that, eventually, regardless of S(0), S(t) becomes (I + M + M^2 + ... + M^{t-1}) D mod2.

But with D being all ones, perhaps after sufficient iterations, the sum (I + M + ... + M^{k-1}) becomes the zero matrix, leading S(t) just depending on the initial state. Wait, but this seems abstract. Maybe I need another approach.

Alternatively, as we saw in the small n case, when n is a power of two, the system can be decomposed into independent systems or something that allows convergence.

Alternatively, think of the dynamics as solving equations in GF(2). Let's suppose that the system is convergent if the transformation matrix (I - M) is invertible. Because if we can solve (I - M)c = D, then the system has a unique fixed point c. But the original system with affine term S(t+1) = M S(t) + D. If there is a fixed point, then S = M S + D → (I - M) S = D. If (I - M) is invertible, then the fixed point is unique. However, even if (I - M) is not invertible, the system might still converge if starting from any initial state, the iterations lead to S(t) approaching the solution of (I - M) S = D. But over GF(2), the convergence is a bit different.

But perhaps in this specific problem, the only fixed point is the all-ones vector, and if n is a power of two, the system will converge to that fixed point regardless of the initial state. The previous examples seem to support this: n=1 (2^0), 2 (2^1), 4 (2^2) work, n=3 doesn't.

Alternatively, maybe n being a power of two ensures that the system eventually reaches a fixed point. Therefore, the largest power of two less than 99, which is 64, is the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the key insight is that this process is equivalent to the behavior of a linear cellular automaton with rule 102 (since each cell updates to 1 + itself + left neighbor mod2). Linear cellular automata over rings have known behaviors, and their cycle lengths depend on the size of the ring. Particularly, in GF(2), if the size is a power of two, the automaton may reach a uniform state. When the ring size is a power of two, the state space can be structured in such a way that transients leads the system to the all-ones state. Whereas for other sizes, the presence of non-trivial divisors leads to cycles.

Thus, putting it all together, the desired answer is 64, the highest power of two less than or equal to 99. Therefore, the largest n is \boxed{64}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{64}
