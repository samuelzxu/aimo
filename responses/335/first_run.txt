Okay, let's see. The problem is about n people around a circular table, each being either truthful or a liar. Every minute, everyone answers whether their left neighbor is truthful or a liar, then becomes the type they answered. The goal is to find the largest n (up to 99) such that no matter the initial setup, everyone eventually becomes truthful forever.

Hmm. So, first, the process: Each person's next state depends on their current state and their left neighbor's current state. The user derived a formula using modulo 2 arithmetic: S_i(t+1) = 1 + S_i(t) + S_{i-1}(t) mod 2. This seems like a linear transformation over GF(2), with a constant vector added.

The key observation from the examples: When n is a power of two (like 1, 2, 4), the system converges to all ones (truthful) regardless of initial state. For non-powers of two (like 3, 5), it can enter cycles. So, the answer should be the largest power of two ≤99, which is 64. The reasoning involves understanding how the linear system behaves for different n, especially regarding fixed points and cycles. By testing small cases and recognizing patterns related to powers of two, the conclusion aligns with cellular automata behavior where power-of-two sizes lead to convergence.
