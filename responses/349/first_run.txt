Alright, I need to figure out which parts of the existing reasoning are essential for future steps. The problem involves solving a third-order differential equation with specific initial conditions and finding the smallest nonnegative root. The key steps are:

1. Solving the differential equation by finding the characteristic equation and its roots.
2. Applying initial conditions to determine constants.
3. Analyzing the zeros of the resulting function to find the minimal x where f(x)=0.

Critical points are the general solution of the differential equation, the substitution of initial conditions to find relationships between constants, and the solving for zeros of the trigonometric function. Tokens related to these steps, such as the form of the general solution, the expressions for f(0), f'(0), f''(0), the equations derived from initial conditions, and the solving process for zeros, are essential.
