Alright, let me tackle this problem step by step. The question is about finding the product of two integer solutions, n1 and n2, to the equation P(n) = n + 3, where P(x) is a polynomial with integer coefficients given that P(17) = 10 and P(24) = 17.

First, I need to understand the problem. We have P(x) with integer coefficients, and two specific values: P(17) = 10 and P(24) = 17. The equation P(n) = n + 3 has two distinct integer solutions, and we need their product. 

Starting with the equation P(n) = n + 3, I'll rearrange it to P(n) - n - 3 = 0. Let's define Q(n) = P(n) - n - 3. This new polynomial Q(n) has integer coefficients because P(n) does and we're subtracting linear terms which are also integer polynomials. 

Given the values of P(17) and P(24), substituting these into Q(n) gives:
- Q(17) = P(17) - 17 - 3 = 10 - 17 - 3 = -10
- Q(24) = P(24) - 24 - 3 = 17 - 24 - 3 = -10

So, Q(17) and Q(24) both equal -10. This suggests that Q(n) + 10 has roots at n = 17 and n = 24. Therefore, Q(n) + 10 can be expressed as (n - 17)(n - 24)R(n), where R(n) is another polynomial with integer coefficients. Hence, Q(n) = (n - 17)(n - 24)R(n) - 10.

Now, substituting back into P(n), we get:
P(n) = Q(n) + n + 3 = (n - 17)(n - 24)R(n) - 10 + n + 3.

The equation Q(n) = 0 (which is P(n) = n + 3) becomes:
(n - 17)(n - 24)R(n) - 10 = 0 → (n - 17)(n - 24)R(n) = 10.

Since R(n) must be an integer for integer n, the product (n - 17)(n - 24) must divide 10. Let’s denote a = n - 17 and b = n - 24, noting that a - b = 7. We need integers a and b such that their product (a * b) divides 10, and their difference is 7.

Testing possible factor pairs of 10 considering the difference of 7:
- For (n - 17)(n - 24) = -10, possible solutions for n are 19 and 22 (since 19 - 17 = 2, 19 - 24 = -5, product = -10; and 22 - 17 = 5, 22 - 24 = -2, product = -10).

Thus, the solutions are n1 = 19 and n2 = 22. Their product is 19 * 22 = 418.

Finally, verifying with the quadratic polynomial P(n) derived from Q(n) = - (n - 17)(n - 24) - 10 + n + 3 confirms that these values satisfy P(n) = n + 3 and the given conditions P(17) = 10 and P(24) = 17.
