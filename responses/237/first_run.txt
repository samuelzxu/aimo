Okay, let's start by understanding the problem. We have two runners, Radford and Peter, with Radford starting 30 meters ahead. After 3 minutes, Peter is 18 meters ahead. Peter wins the race in 7 minutes, and we need to find how far Radford was from the finish line when Peter won.

First, setting up their speeds. Let Peter's speed be \( v_p \) and Radford's \( v_r \). The positions over time are:
- Peter: \( P(t) = v_p t \)
- Radford: \( R(t) = 30 + v_r t \)

At \( t = 3 \), Peter is 18 meters ahead:
\[ 3v_p - (30 + 3v_r) = 18 \]
\[ 3(v_p - v_r) = 48 \]
\[ v_p - v_r = 16 \, \text{m/min} \]

Peter finishes in 7 minutes, so the race distance \( D \) is:
\[ D = 7v_p \]

Radford's position at \( t = 7 \) is:
\[ R(7) = 30 + 7v_r \]

The remaining distance for Radford:
\[ D - (30 + 7v_r) = 7v_p - 30 - 7v_r \]
Substituting \( v_p = v_r + 16 \):
\[ 7(v_r + 16) - 30 - 7v_r = 112 - 30 = 82 \, \text{meters} \]

Checking with specific values confirms the answer. Thus, the final answer is 82 meters.
