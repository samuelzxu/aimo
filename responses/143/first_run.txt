Okay, let's break down the problem. Clayton starts at vertex 2 (M) and writes the letter. Each second, he moves to an adjacent vertex with equal probability and writes the letter. The goal is to find the expected length of the string until it contains M, A, T, H in order.

First, the hexagon's vertices are labeled M, M, A, T, H, S. The transitions between vertices form a symmetric random walk. We model the expected steps using a Markov chain considering both the current vertex and the progress towards the sequence M-A-T-H.

We define states based on progress:
- Progress 1: M found, need A
- Progress 2: M-A found, need T
- Progress 3: M-A-T found, need H

For each vertex and progress state, we set up equations for the expected steps. Solving these equations involves linear algebra, considering dependencies between states.

Key steps:
1. Set up equations for each vertex and progress state.
2. Solve the system of equations starting from progress 3 (simpler due to absorption at H).
3. Substitute results into equations for progress 2 and then progress 1.
4. Compute the final expected steps starting from vertex 2 (M) with progress 1.

After solving, the expected number of steps is 15, leading to an expected string length of 1 (initial M) + 15 = 16.

Paragraph 1, Sentence 1: <keep>Consider a hexagon with vertices labeled  $M$ ,  $M$ ,  $A$ ,  $T$ ,  $H$ ,  $S$  in that order.</keep>  
Paragraph 1, Sentence 2: <keep>Clayton starts at the  $M$  adjacent to  $M$  and  $A$ , and writes the letter down.</keep>  
Paragraph 1, Sentence 3: <keep>Each second, Clayton moves to an adjacent vertex, each with probability  $\frac{1}{2}$ , and writes down the corresponding letter.</keep>  
Paragraph 1, Sentence 4: <keep>Clayton stops moving when the string he's written down contains the letters  $M, A, T$ , and  $H$  in that order, not necessarily consecutively.</keep>  
Paragraph 1, Sentence 5: <keep>What is the expected length of the string Clayton wrote?</keep>  
Paragraph 2, Sentence 1: <keep>Alright, so we have this problem about a hexagon with vertices labeled M, M, A, T, H, S in order.</keep>  
Paragraph 2, Sentence 2: <keep>Clayton starts at the M adjacent to M and A, which I think is the first M in the list.</keep>  
Paragraph 2, Sentence 3: <keep>Each second, he moves to an adjacent vertex with probability 1/2 each, writes down the letter, and stops when his string contains the letters M, A, T, H in that order.</keep>  
Paragraph 2, Sentence 4: <keep>We need to find the expected length of the string he writes.</keep>  
Paragraph 3, Sentence 1: <keep>Hmm, okay. Let me first visualize the hexagon.</keep>  
Paragraph 3, Sentence 2: <keep>Since it's a hexagon, each vertex is connected to two others.</keep>  
Paragraph 3, Sentence 3: <keep>The labels are M, M, A, T, H, S in order.</keep>  
Paragraph 3, Sentence 4: <keep>So if we go around the hexagon, the vertices are:</keep>  
Paragraph 4, Sentence 1: <keep>1. M  
2. M  
3. A  
4. T  
5. H  
6. S</keep>  
Paragraph 4, Sentence 2: <keep>And then back to M.</keep>  
Paragraph 4, Sentence 3: <keep>Wait, the starting vertex is the M adjacent to M and A.</keep>  
Paragraph 4, Sentence 4: <keep>So vertex 1 is adjacent to vertex 6 and vertex 2.</keep>  
Paragraph 4, Sentence 5: <keep>But vertex 2 is adjacent to vertex 1 and vertex 3.</keep>  
Paragraph 4, Sentence 6: <keep>So Clayton starts at vertex 2, the M that is between M (vertex 1) and A (vertex 3).</keep>  
Paragraph 5, Sentence 1: <keep>The goal is to compute the expected number of letters he writes before the string contains M, A, T, H in order.</keep>  
Paragraph 5, Sentence 2: <keep>This is similar to a Markov chain problem where we track the progression towards the target sequence M-A-T-H.</keep>  
Paragraph 5, Sentence 3: <keep>Each step, the state could represent the current progress towards completing the sequence.</keep>  
Paragraph 6, Sentence 1: <keep>We model this as a Markov chain where the state is the current position on the hexagon and the current progress in the sequence M-A-T-H.</keep>  
Paragraph 6, Sentence 2: <keep>Define E(v, p) as the expected number of steps remaining to reach state 4 (absorbing) from vertex v and progress p.</keep>  
Paragraph 6, Sentence 3: <keep>Our goal is E(2, 1), since starting at vertex 2 (M) with progress 1.</keep>  
Paragraph 7, Sentence 1: <keep>Key transitions:  
- Progress 1: Needs A  
- Progress 2: Needs T  
- Progress 3: Needs H</keep>  
Paragraph 8, Sentence 1: <keep>Equations for E(v, p) account for transitions between vertices and progress states.</keep>  
Paragraph 8, Sentence 2: <keep>Solve the system of linear equations step-by-step starting from progress 3.</keep>  
Paragraph 8, Sentence 3: <keep>Progress 3 equations: E(4,3) = 1 + (1/2)E(3,3), leading to E(4,3)=5, E(6,3)=5, etc.</keep>  
Paragraph 8, Sentence 4: <keep>Progress 2 equations: E(3,2) = 1 + (1/2)E(2,2) + (1/2)E(4,3), resulting in E(3,2)=10.</keep>  
Paragraph 8, Sentence 5: <keep>Progress 1 equations: E(2,1) = 15, giving total length = 1 + 15 = 16.</keep>  
Paragraph 9, Sentence 1: <keep>The final answer is determined by solving the Markov chain equations and summing the initial M with the expected steps.</keep>  
Paragraph 9, Sentence 2: <keep>Thus, the expected length of the string Clayton wrote is \boxed{16}.</keep>
