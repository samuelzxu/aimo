Alright, so I need to figure out the minimum number of forbidden squares Andile needs to declare to ensure he wins the game. Let me go through the problem step by step.

The game is played on a 2017x2017 board. Andile declares some squares forbidden, and then Zandre and Andile take turns placing coins such that no two coins share the same row or column. The last player to place a coin wins. Andile wants to make sure he can force a win with the least number of forbidden squares.

First, understanding the game mechanics: Each coin placed blocks a row and a column. The maximum number of coins that can be placed is 2017, as each uses a unique row and column. Since Zandre goes first, if the maximum number of moves is odd (2017), Zandre wins. To make Andile win, the maximum number of moves must be even (2016). Therefore, Andile needs to reduce the maximum matching from 2017 to 2016.

Key concept: In a complete bipartite graph K_{n,n} (which the board is initially), removing edges (forbidden squares) to reduce the maximum matching. Konig's theorem relates maximum matching and minimum vertex cover. To reduce the maximum matching by 1, the minimum vertex cover must be reduced by 1. The most straightforward way is to remove all edges incident to a single vertex (row or column), which requires 2017 forbidden squares.

Alternative approaches were considered, like removing fewer squares, but analysis via Hall's theorem showed that removing fewer squares (even spread out) doesn't guarantee maximum matching reduction. For example, blocking one square per row in different columns doesn't violate Hall's condition sufficiently for larger subsets.

Example: For a 2x2 grid, blocking one square doesnâ€™t reduce the maximum matching, but blocking an entire row (2 squares) does. Similarly, for a 3x3 grid, blocking a whole row (3 squares) is required. Extending this logic to 2017x2017, blocking a whole row (2017 squares) ensures the maximum matching is 2016 (even), allowing Andile to win.

Thus, the minimal number of forbidden squares required is 2017.
