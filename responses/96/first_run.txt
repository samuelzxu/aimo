Okay, let's go through the problem again step by step to make sure I didn't miss anything. The goal is to find the coordinates of point P(-14, 27) in the new coordinate system where line L is the x-axis and line M is the y-axis, then compute α + β.

First, I need to determine the equations of lines L and M. Line L has a slope of 5/12 and passes through point A(24, -1). Using the point-slope form:

y + 1 = (5/12)(x - 24)
Multiplying through by 12 gives:
12y + 12 = 5x - 120
So, the equation of line L is 5x - 12y = 132.

Line M is perpendicular to L with a slope of -12/5 and passes through point B(5, 6). Its equation is:
y - 6 = (-12/5)(x - 5)
Multiplying through by 5:
5y - 30 = -12x + 60
Which simplifies to 12x + 5y = 90.

Next, find the intersection point O of lines L and M, which will be the origin of the new coordinate system. Solving the system:
5x - 12y = 132
12x + 5y = 90

Using the elimination method, multiply the first equation by 5 and the second by 12:
25x - 60y = 660
144x + 60y = 1080
Adding these:
169x = 1740 → x = 1740/169
Substitute x back into 12x + 5y = 90 to find y:
12*(1740/169) + 5y = 90
5y = 90 - (20880/169) → y = -1134/169

So, the origin O is (1740/169, -1134/169).

Next, translate point P(-14, 27) by subtracting the coordinates of O:
x' = -14 - 1740/169 = (-2366 - 1740)/169 = -4106/169
y' = 27 + 1134/169 = (4563 + 1134)/169 = 5697/169

Now, rotate the translated coordinates by angle θ where tanθ = 5/12. The rotation uses cosθ = 12/13 and sinθ = 5/13.

Compute α and β using the rotation matrix:
α = x'*cosθ + y'*sinθ = (-4106/169)*(12/13) + (5697/169)*(5/13) = (-20787)/2197
β = -x'*sinθ + y'*cosθ = -(-4106/169)*(5/13) + (5697/169)*(12/13) = 88894/2197

Adding α and β:
α + β = (-20787 + 88894)/2197 = 68107/2197 = 31

The final answer is 31.
