Okay, let's try to figure out which parts of the reasoning are essential to keep for solving this problem. The user is asking to optimize the context by marking critical tokens with <keep> tags. 

First, the problem involves counting functions f: Z/16Z → Z/16Z satisfying a specific equation. The functional equation is quadratic and involves terms like f(a)^2 and products f(a)f(b)f(a+b). Key steps are analyzing the equation by setting variables (like a=0) to derive constraints on f(0), then determining possible forms of f(b) based on quadratic residues modulo 16.

The critical points are:

1. Setting a=0 to derive conditions on f(0) leads to solving 2x ≡ 1 mod 16, which has no solution, implying f(b)^2 must be constant for all b.
2. Evaluating the case when f(0) must satisfy 2x³ -3x² +1 ≡ 0 mod 16. Testing values from 0 to 15 finds solutions x=1,5,9,13.
3. For each x (f(0)), compute c=(1-2x²)/(1-2x) mod 16. This c must be a quadratic residue (0,1,4,9). Calculations show c=1 when x=1,9 and c=9 when x=5,13.
4. When c=1, f(b) ∈ {1,7,9,15} but must satisfy f(a) ≡1 mod8 to ensure the product term matches the equation. Thus, only f(b)=1 or9 are valid.
5. Similarly, for c=9, f(b) ∈ {3,5,11,13} must be 5 mod8, so f(b)=5 or13.
6. Counting the number of functions: For c=1 and c=9, each allows 2 choices for f(0) and 2^15 choices for other elements. Total N=2*2^16=2^17.
7. Finally, compute 2^17 mod 2017. Using modular exponentiation, 2^17 ≡ 1984 mod 2017.

These steps highlight the necessity of understanding how setting variables, solving congruences, and modular arithmetic lead to determining the number of valid functions and the final modulo result. Essential parts include the equations derived, critical x values, quadratic residues, and the counting logic.
