Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem step by step. The goal is to figure out which solutions are in each tube based on their precipitation reactions and then calculate the sum of their molecular weights. Here's how I worked through it:

1. **Identifying Key Clues:**
   - **Clue g)** Mixing solutions 3 and 4 forms a precipitate that dissolves upon heating and reappears when cooled. This behavior is characteristic of PbCl₂, which has temperature-dependent solubility.
   - **Clue f)** Mixing solutions 2 and 4 initially doesn't form a precipitate. This suggests that the precipitate forms only after some time or with higher concentrations, possibly involving CaSO₄, which has low solubility.

2. **Assigning Solutions 3 and 4:**
   - Since PbCl₂ fits the behavior in clue g, one of these solutions must provide Pb²⁺ (Pb(NO₃)₂) and the other Cl⁻ (CaCl₂). I assigned:
     - **Solution 3:** Pb(NO₃)₂ (provides Pb²⁺)
     - **Solution 4:** CaCl₂ (provides Cl⁻)

3. **Determining Solution 2:**
   - **Clue a)** Solution 2 reacts with 1, 3, and 4. For this, Na₂SO₄ is a candidate because sulfates of Ba²⁺, Pb²⁺, and Ca²⁺ are insoluble.
     - **Solution 2:** Na₂SO₄ (provides SO₄²⁻)

4. **Assigning Solution 1:**
   - **Clue d)** Solution 1 doesn't react with 3 and 4. Ba(NO₃)₂ fits as it wouldn't precipitate with Pb(NO₃)₂ or CaCl₂.
     - **Solution 1:** Ba(NO₃)₂ (provides Ba²⁺)

5. **Assigning Solution 5:**
   - **Clue b)** Solution 5 reacts with 1, 3, and 4. Na₂CO₃ is suitable because carbonates of Ba²⁺, Pb²⁺, and Ca²⁺ are insoluble.
     - **Solution 5:** Na₂CO₃ (provides CO₃²⁻)

6. **Validating Clues:**
   - **Clue e)** Solutions 2 and 5 (Na₂SO₄ and Na₂CO₃) don't react, as both are sodium salts and soluble.
   - **Clue f)** Na₂SO₄ and CaCl₂ mixing doesn't immediately precipitate CaSO₄ due to its low solubility product, aligning with the observation.

7. **Calculating Molecular Weights:**
   - **Ba(NO₃)₂:** 261.35 g/mol
   - **Na₂SO₄:** 142.05 g/mol
   - **CaCl₂:** 110.98 g/mol
   - **Sum:** 261.35 + 142.05 + 110.98 = 514.38 g/mol, which falls in the range 511–523 (Option D).

Throughout this process, each clue was systematically analyzed to eliminate possibilities and confirm assignments. The critical insight was leveraging the temperature-dependent solubility of PbCl₂ and the behavior of CaSO₄ to align with the experimental observations.
