Okay, let's break down the problem and the solution to identify the essential tokens needed for future reasoning steps. The problem involves a series of triangles where each new triangle is formed by extending a side of the previous one with a specific ratio. The goal is to determine the smallest K such that the area of the pasture never exceeds K.

The key steps involve:

1. **Initial Triangle Analysis**: Understanding the 30-60-90 triangle properties and calculating the initial area.
2. **Coordinate Assignments**: Placing points in a coordinate system to compute areas systematically.
3. **Extension Ratios**: Applying the given ratio formula for each extension step.
4. **Area Calculations**: Using the shoelace formula to compute areas of subsequent triangles.
5. **Pattern Recognition**: Observing that each new area forms a geometric series converging to √3.

The essential tokens include the coordinate assignments (as they form the basis for area calculations), the ratio formula (critical for determining each new point's position), and the observed pattern of areas approaching √3. These elements are crucial for verifying the convergence and concluding the value of K.

Here are the marked tokens:

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 3: <keep>triangle $A_0A_1A_2$ is a right-angled triangle with angles 90°, 60°, and 30°, side $A_0A_1$ is 1, sides opposite 60° and 30° are √3 and 2, initial area is √3/2</keep>

- Paragraph 3, Sentence 1: <keep>coordinates assigned: $A_0$ at (0,0), $A_1$ at (1,0), $A_2$ at (0,√3)</keep>

- Paragraph 4, Sentence 1: <keep>first extension: $A_3$ at (0, -√3/2) using ratio 1/2, new area of triangle $A_1A_2A_3$ calculated via shoelace formula as 3√3/4</keep>

- Paragraph 5, Sentence 1: <keep>second extension: $A_4$ calculated using ratio 1/6, coordinates (7/6, √3/12), area 7√3/8</keep>

- Paragraph 6, Sentence 1: <keep>third extension: $A_5$ calculated using ratio 1/14, coordinates (-1/12, 179√3/168), area 15√3/16</keep>

- Paragraph 7, Sentence 1: <keep>observed pattern of areas forming a geometric series: S_n = (2^{n+1} -1)√3 / 2^{n+1}</keep>

- Paragraph 8, Sentence 1: <keep>series converges to √3, hence K = √3</keep>

Each of these blocks captures critical steps in the reasoning process, ensuring that the key calculations and observations are retained for future steps. The coordinate assignments and shoelace formula applications are fundamental for area computations, while the ratio formula and observed pattern drive the convergence conclusion.
