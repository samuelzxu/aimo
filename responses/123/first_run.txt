Okay, so the user needs help identifying which parts of the reasoning trace should be kept for future steps. Let me go through the problem and the provided thinking trajectory carefully.

The question is to find the wind power \( P_w \) in terms of \( P \) and \( T_2/T_1 \). The thinking process starts by recalling the wind power formula and considering how temperature affects air density via the ideal gas law. It then connects the density ratio to the temperature ratio, leading to the conclusion that \( P_w = P \cdot \frac{T_1}{T_2} \).

First, I need to find which tokens are essential for future reasoning. The key steps are:

1. The initial wind power formula involving density.
2. The relation of density to temperature via the ideal gas law.
3. The substitution of the density ratio into the power equation.
4. The final expression derived in terms of \( P \) and \( T_2/T_1 \).

Looking at each paragraph:

Paragraph 2 introduces the wind power formula and the effect of temperature on density. The sentence about the ideal gas law here is crucial because it links density to temperature.

Paragraph 3 calculates the density ratio and substitutes it into the power formula. The derivation steps here directly lead to the final answer, so they must be kept.

Paragraph 5 confirms the reasoning by checking the logical consistency, which reinforces the critical steps but may not need to be kept unless specific confirmations are required.

Paragraph 6 reviews the steps, which restates the key substitution, making it important for continuity.

The final answer is, of course, necessary but already boxed, so perhaps less critical in the kept reasoning, but the derivation before it is key.

So, important sections to tag:

1. The explanation linking density to temperature via the ideal gas law (Paragraph 2).
2. The substitution of the density ratio into the power equation (Paragraph 3).
3. The concluding derivation showing \( P_w = P \cdot \frac{T_1}{T_2} \) (Paragraph 3 and 4).

Checking each sentence:

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 3: The ideal gas law relation \( \rho = \frac{P}{R T} \). This establishes the dependency of density on temperature, which is fundamental.
- Paragraph 3, Sentences 3 and 4: The substitution of \( \rho_2 \) into \( P_w \) leading to \( P \cdot (T_1 / T_2) \). This directly leads to the answer.
- Paragraph 6, Step 3: Restating the substitution step, which reinforces the critical derivation.

These sections capture the necessary steps without redundancy, ensuring that future reasoning can follow the key substitutions and relationships.
