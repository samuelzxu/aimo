Okay, let's go through this step by step. So the problem is about finding the probability that a randomly colored 3x3 grid doesn't contain any 2x2 entirely red squares. The answer needs to be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then we sum them up.

First, the total number of colorings is 2^9 = 512. That part seems straightforward.

Then, to find the number of colorings without any all-red 2x2 squares, we use complementary counting. That means calculating the number of colorings with at least one all-red 2x2 and subtracting from the total.

Now, figuring out the number of colorings with at least one all-red 2x2. There are four 2x2 subgrids in a 3x3 grid. Each subgrid has 2^5 = 32 colorings where it's all red. So 4 * 32 = 128. But wait, this counts overlaps multiple times, so we need inclusion-exclusion.

Next, subtract overlaps. For pairs of 2x2 subgrids: some overlap in a 2x1 block (contributing 8 colorings each) and others overlap at a single square (contributing 4 each). There are 4 pairs of the first type and 2 of the second, so 4*8 + 2*4 = 40. So we subtract 40.

Then, adding back in the trios. Each trio of subgrids leaves one square free, so 2 colorings per trio. There are 4 trios, so 4*2 = 8. Add that.

Finally, subtract the one coloring where all four subgrids are red (the entire grid). So total becomes 128 - 40 + 8 - 1 = 95. Therefore, 512 - 95 = 417 colorings without any all-red 2x2.

Check if 417 and 512 are coprime. 512 is 2^9, and 417 is divisible by 3 (sum digits 4+1+7=12). 417/3=139, which is prime. No common factors with 512, so m=417, n=512, and m+n=929. That seems right.
