Okay, so I have this problem here about an infinite sequence of real numbers where each term from the fourth term onwards is defined by a recurrence relation: a_{n+3} = a_{n+2} - 2a_{n+1} + a_n. The initial conditions given are a1 = 1, a3 = 1, and they also tell me that a98 = a99. I need to compute the sum of the first 100 terms, from a1 up to a100.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, linear recurrences usually relate to characteristic equations. Maybe I can find the characteristic equation here. The recurrence is linear and homogeneous with constant coefficients. Let me recall: for such recursions, we first find the characteristic polynomial by assuming a solution of the form a_n = r^n. Substituting this into the recurrence should give me a polynomial equation in r.

So, let's try that. If I substitute a_n = r^n into the recurrence a_{n+3} = a_{n+2} - 2a_{n+1} + a_n, we get:

r^{n+3} = r^{n+2} - 2r^{n+1} + r^n.

Divide both sides by r^n (assuming r ≠ 0):

r3 = r2 - 2r + 1.

So the characteristic equation is:

r3 - r2 + 2r - 1 = 0.

Hmm, I need to solve this cubic equation. Let's see if it has any rational roots. Maybe I can try Rational Root Theorem. Possible rational roots would be ±1, since the constant term is 1 and leading coefficient is 1.

Testing r=1: 1 - 1 + 2 - 1 = 1. Not zero.

Testing r=-1: -1 - 1 - 2 -1 = -5. Not zero.

So no rational roots. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. The characteristic equation is r3 - r2 + 2r - 1? Wait, let's rederive that. So the original recurrence is a_{n+3} = a_{n+2} - 2a_{n+1} + a_n. Then, bringing all terms to the left: a_{n+3} - a_{n+2} + 2a_{n+1} - a_n = 0. Therefore, the characteristic equation is r3 - r2 + 2r - 1 = 0. Yes, that's correct.

So if this cubic doesn't have rational roots, maybe we can factor it or use some substitutions. Let me try to factor it. Perhaps it factors as (r2 + ar + b)(r + c). Let's see:

(r2 + ar + b)(r + c) = r3 + (a + c)r2 + (ac + b)r + bc.

Now, set coefficients equal to characteristic equation:

1. Coefficient of r3: 1 = 1 (OK).
2. Coefficient of r2: a + c = -1.
3. Coefficient of r: ac + b = 2.
4. Constant term: bc = -1.

Now, we need to solve for a, b, c. From the last equation bc = -1. Possible integers solutions for b and c here could be (1, -1) or (-1, 1). Let's check both.

First possibility: b = 1, c = -1. Then, from a + c = -1 => a -1 = -1 => a = 0. Then ac + b = (0)(-1) +1 = 1 ≠ 2. Not valid.

Second possibility: b = -1, c = 1. Then from a + 1 = -1 => a = -2. Then ac + b = (-2)(1) + (-1) = -2 -1 = -3 ≠ 2. Not valid. Hmm. So it doesn't factor like that, at least not with integers.

Another way: maybe use the rational root theorem with real roots or use depressed cubic? Alternatively, maybe it's a cubic with one real root and two complex roots. Let's check.

Using the rational root theorem didn't work, as it has no rational roots. Let me attempt to find roots via the method of depressed cubic or apply Cardano's formula. Let me check if the cubic can be rewritten as r3 + pr2 + qr + s =0.

Wait, current cubic: r3 - r2 +2 r -1.

To apply Cardano's method, we need to get rid of the quadratic term. Let me substitute r = x + t to eliminate the x2 term. If r = x + t, then:

(x + t)^3 - (x + t)^2 +2(x + t) -1 =0.

Expanding this:

x3 + 3t x2 + 3t2x + t3 - x2 -2t x - t2 +2x +2t -1=0.

Combine like terms:

x3 + (3t -1)x2 + (3t2 -2t +2)x + (t3 - t2 +2t -1) =0.

Set the coefficient of x2 to zero: 3t -1 =0 => t =1/3.

So substituting t=1/3, then the transformed cubic should have no x2 term. So the cubic is:

x3 + [3*(1/3)^2 - 2*(1/3) +2]x + [(1/3)^3 - (1/3)^2 +2*(1/3) -1] = 0.

Calculate coefficients step by step.

First, coefficient for x:

3t2 -2t +2 with t =1/3.

3*(1/3)^2 - 2*(1/3) +2 = 3*(1/9) - 2/3 +2 = 1/3 - 2/3 +2 = (-1/3 +2) =5/3.

Now, the constant term:

t3 -t2 +2t -1=(1/3)^3 - (1/3)^2 + 2*(1/3) -1= 1/27 -1/9 +2/3 -1.

Convert to common denominator:

1/27 -3/27 +18/27 -27/27= (1-3+18-27)/27= (-11)/27.

Thus, transformed cubic: x3 + (5/3)x -11/27=0 or multiply by 27:27x3 +45x -11 =0. Hmm, so now we have the depressed cubic x3 + px + q=0 where p=5/3, q=-11/27.

Now applying Cardano's formula: solutions are x=∛(-q/2 +√(q2/4 +p3/27)) + ∛(-q/2 -√(q2/4 +p3/27)).

But this might get complicated, but perhaps real.

Alternatively, perhaps Descartes' Rule of Signs. How many positive and negative real roots does the original cubic have?

Original cubic: r3 - r2 +2 r -1. For positive roots: coefficients signs are +, -, +, -, which has three sign changes, so 3 or 1 positive roots. And substituting r=0, gives -1, so f(0)= -1. At r=1, as before, f(1)=1-1+2-1=1. So between 0 and 1, the function goes from -1 to 1. So at least one positive root between 0 and1. Then testing r=2: 8 -4 +4 -1=7, so increasing. Therefore, only one real root (since it is a cubic must have at least one) and two complex roots.

Therefore, the general solution for the sequence would be a combination of the real root and the two complex roots. But that seems a bit involved for a problem that later gives a condition like a98 =a99. Maybe expecting that subsequences stabilize or sum to zero?

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is linearly recursive of order 3, so that sums can be telescoped? Maybe I need to relate this recurrence to the sum? Let's compute the sum S =a1+a2+...+a100. If I can find a relation between S and the terms?

Alternatively, perhaps there is a telescoping sum here. Let's see the recurrence: a_{n+3} =a_{n+2} -2a_{n+1} +a_n. If I sum both sides from n=1 to n=97. Then:

Sum_{n=1 to97} a_{n+3} = Sum_{n=1 to97} [a_{n+2} -2a_{n+1} +a_n]

Left side is Sum_{n=1 to97} a_{n+3}= Sum_{k=4}^{100} a_k = S - (a1 +a2 +a3)

Right side: Sum_{n=1 to97} a_{n+2} -2Sum_{n=1 to97} a_{n+1} + Sum_{n=1 to97} a_n

Which is Sum_{k=3}^{99} a_k -2 Sum_{k=2}^{98} a_k + Sum_{k=1}^{97} a_k

Compute each:

Sum_{k=3}^{99} a_k = (S -a1 -a2 -a_{100}) ) [Wait, original sum is up to a100, so subtract a100]

Wait, perhaps write them in terms of S:

Original sum S = a1 +a2 + ... + a100

So Sum_{k=3}^{99} a_k = S - a1 -a2 -a_{100}

Similarly, Sum_{k=2}^{98} a_k = S - a1 -a_{99} -a_{100}

And Sum_{k=1}^{97} a_k = S -a_{98} -a_{99} -a_{100}

Wait, let's do the conversion step by step.

First term: Sum_{n=1}^{97} a_{n+2} = Sum_{k=3}^{99} a_k because n+2 varies from 3 to 97+2=99.

Similarly, Sum_{n=1}^{97} a_{n+1} = Sum_{k=2}^{98} a_k.

Sum_{n=1}^{97} a_n = Sum_{k=1}^{97} a_k.

So substitution gives:

Left side: Sum_{k=4}^{100} a_k

Sum_{k=4}^{100} a_k = Sum_{k=4}^{100} a_k.

Thus equation is:

Sum_{k=4}^{100} a_k = [Sum_{k=3}^{99} a_k] -2[Sum_{k=2}^{98} a_k] + [Sum_{k=1}^{97} a_k}.

Express all these sums in terms of S and the other terms.

Left side Sum_{4}^{100} = S -a1 -a2 -a3.

Right side:

Sum_{k=3}^{99} a_k = S -a1 -a2 -a_{100},

Minus 2 Sum_{k=2}^{98} a_k = -2(S -a1 -a_{99} -a_{100}}),

Plus Sum_{k=1}^{97} = S -a_{98} -a_{99} -a_{100}}.

So putting it all together:

Left side: S -a1 -a2 -a3

Right side:

[ S - a1 -a2 -a100 ] -2[ S - a1 -a99 -a100 ] + [ S - a98 -a99 -a100 ]

Compute right side step by step.

First term: [S - a1 -a2 -a100]

Second term: -2[S - a1 -a99 -a100]

Third term: [S - a98 -a99 -a100]

Combine these:

1. Expand each term:

First term: S - a1 -a2 -a100

Second term: -2S +2a1 +2a99 +2a100

Third term: S -a98 -a99 -a100

Combine all terms:

S - a1 -a2 -a100 -2S +2a1 +2a99 +2a100 + S -a98 -a99 -a100

Now, combine like terms:

S -2S +S = 0.

For a1 terms: -a1 +2a1= a1.

For a2 terms: -a2.

For a98 terms: -a98

For a99 terms:2a99 -a99= a99.

For a100 terms:-a100 +2a100 -a100=0.

So the total expression on the right simplifies to a1 -a2 -a98 +a99.

Therefore, equating left and right side:

Left: S -a1 -a2 -a3 = Right: a1 -a2 - a98 +a99.

So S -a1 -a2 -a3 = a1 -a2 -a98 +a99.

Bring all terms to the left:

S -a1 -a2 -a3 -a1 +a2 +a98 -a99 =0.

Simplify:

S -2a1 -a3 +a98 -a99=0.

But we are given that a98 =a99, so a98 -a99=0. Also, given a1=1, a3=1.

Substituting:

S -2(1) -1 +0=0 => S -2 -1=0 => S=3.

But wait. The answer is 3? So the sum from a1 to a100 is 3? That seems surprisingly small. Let me check my steps again. Because if true, then it's quite elegant. Let me recap.

We derived:

Sum a44 to a100 (left side) got expressed in terms of other sums when I think the user specified sum from a1 to a100. Hmm, stepping back, let me check what the left side was:

Left side: Sum_{n=1}^{97} a_{n+3} = Sum_{k=4}^{100} a_k = Sum from a4 to a100.

So left side is S -a1 -a2 -a3 = sum from a4 to a100.

Right side after breaking down simplifies to a1 -a2 -a98 + a99.

Hence, when we set that Sum_{a4 to a100} =a1 -a2 -a98 + a99. Then S -a1 -a2 -a3 = a1 -a2 -a98 + a99. Then solving for S: S = 2a1 + a3 -a98 +a99. Then given that a98 =a99, so -a98 +a99=0. Therefore, S=2a1 +a3. Given that a1=1 and a3=1, then S=2*1 +1=3.

Yes, that's correct. Therefore, the sum is 3. But that seems really small. Maybe that is the answer. Let's verify independently.

Alternatively, if the sum is 3, then a98 =a99. Let me see if the sequence becomes periodic or constants after a certain point.

Alternatively, perhaps considering the recurrence relation: a_{n+3}=a_{n+2} -2a_{n+1} +a_n. So this is a linear recurrence with some behavior. If at some point consecutive terms are equal, maybe the subsequent terms follow some pattern?

But if a98 =a99, let's see what a100 would be.

Using the recurrence with n=97:

a_{100}=a_{99} -2a_{98} +a_{97}.

But since a98 =a99, then:

a100= a98 -2a98 +a97= -a98 +a97.

Similarly, next term (if we computed a101= a100 -2a99 +a98=(-a98 +a97) -2a98 +a98= (-a98 +a97) - a98 +0= a97 -2a98.

But since we are only concerned with a1 to a100, perhaps beyond a98 and a99 is involved in our sum is only up to a100. But anyway, let's see that a100= -a98 +a97.

But given that from the sum this S=3.

The reason why the sum telescopes down might also suggest that even if the sequence continues with no particular pattern, the sum of the first 100 terms is still 3. The key here was utilizing the recurrence to relate the sum and the conditions given. Provided that at some point two consecutive terms are equal (a98=a99), this allows the coefficients involving a98 -a99 to cancel out, resulting in the sum S=2a1 +a3=2*1 +1=3. The critical component was using the recurrence relation to express the sum in terms of the initial terms and the given condition.

Therefore, the given answer seems consistent. Though perhaps I should test with small cases. Let's try to compute terms up to, say, a6, and see if the initial terms would sum to 3?

Wait, we have a1=1, a3=1, but what about a2? The value of a2 is not provided. Hmm, but in the sum S, if S=3, given that a1+a3=2, then the sum from a2+a4+...+a100 would be S -2=1. Hmm, but if the user didn't specify a2, how is the sum fixed? But in our recurrence, moving from S=2a1+a3 would suggest that a2 isn't involved. Let's check.

The expression I derived for the sum S is S=2a1+a3. So given a1 and a3, with a1=1 and a3=1, then S=3 regardless of a2. But that is due to the relation enforced via a98=a99 and sum telescoping. So even if a2 is some variable value, given the a98=a99 collapses other terms? Interesting.

But how is a2 determined? With the initial conditions a1=1, a3=1, but for a linear recurrence of order 3, we need typically three initial conditions. However, the problem provides a3=1. Suppose that we can write into the recurrence to find a2.

Given that for n=1:

a_{4}=a_{3} -2a_{2} +a_{1}.

But a1=1, a3=1, so a4=1 -2a2 +1=2 -2a2.

Similarly, for n=2:

a5= a4 -2a3 +a2= (2 -2a2) -2(1) +a2=2 -2a2 -2 +a2= -a2.

For n=3:

a6= a5 -2a4 +a3= (-a2) -2(2 -2a2) +1= -a2 -4 +4a2 +1=3a2 -3.

Hmm. So to find a2, perhaps we could use then later terms, but the problem only gives that a98 = a99. Which is way later somewhere. However, given that the summation S is a1+a2+...+a100=3 independent of a2. Intriguing. But is that possible?

Wait, if in the end S depends only on a1, a3, and given that a98=a99, is that possible? In our previous steps, yes, S=3 regardless of initial terms. But in reality, I must have made a substitution that considered a98=a99. Thus, given that information and the initial terms, S=3. The logic so far checks out.

Alternatively, thinking in terms of linear algebra. Any linear recursion for sequences can be viewed as a linear transformation, and given the recurrence being a linear combination, maybe a shift operator. If the conditions imply that the sequence stabilizes in some way, perhaps a98=a99 causes terms to follow a particular pattern. However, even considering that, given the recursion, each term is dependent on previous terms, and if a98=a99, then that might affect the subsequent terms.

But in any case, considering the sum was possible to compute just via telescoping through the recurrence, and gives S=3 which depends only on a1 and a3, and the collapse of a98 -a99. Since a98 =a99 (provided in problem), their terms canceled out, giving the sum S=3.

Therefore, possibly the answer is 3. I need to confirm is whether the computations were error-free.

Reiterating key steps:

We started with the recurrence: a_{n+3}=a_{n+2}-2a_{n+1}+a_n.

Summed from 1 to 97 for n:

Left side: Sum_{4 to 100} a_k = S -a1 -a2 -a3.

Right side: after expansions simplifies to a1 -a2 -a98 +a99.

Thus,

S -a1 -a2 -a3 = a1 -a2 -a98 +a99.

So then,

S = 2a1 +a3 -a98 +a99 -a98 +a99? Wait, previous steps:

Wait, putting back how S was solved. From the equation:

S -a1 -a2 -a3 =a1 -a2 -a98 +a99

Therefore, moving some terms to the right:

S= a1 -a2 -a98 +a99 +a1 +a2 +a3

Hence,

S=2a1 +a3 -a98 +a99

But since a98 =a99, then -a98 +a99=0, so S= 2a1 +a3.

Given a1=1 and a3=1, which gives S=2*1 +1=3.

Yes, so all that logic. No mistakes here.

Thus, confidence that the answer is 3.

**Final Answer**
The sum of the first 100 terms is \boxed{3}.
