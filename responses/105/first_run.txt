Okay, I need to figure out which parts of the reasoning are essential for future steps. Let me go through each paragraph and identify the key points.

Paragraph 1 introduces the problem and starts thinking about linear recurrences. The key here is setting up the characteristic equation, so the part where they substitute a_n = r^n and derive the equation r³ = r² - 2r + 1 is crucial. Also, checking rational roots is important because it shows that the roots are not simple, leading to the next steps.

In paragraph 2, the user confirms the characteristic equation and tries to factor it. This step is important because it shows that factoring with integer coefficients isn't possible, which explains why another approach is needed. The equations from the factoring attempt need to be kept.

Paragraph 3 discusses the cubic equation and possible roots. The conclusion that there's one real root and two complex roots is key for understanding the general form of the solution. The mention of using Cardano's method isn't detailed, but recognizing the type of roots is important.

Paragraph 4 shifts to summing the recurrence relation. The step where they sum both sides from n=1 to 97 is vital because it sets up the telescoping sum. Expressing each sum in terms of S (the total sum) and substituting the given conditions (a98 = a99) are critical steps. The detailed breakdown of the sums and their translation into components of S must be preserved.

In paragraph 5, the user simplifies the equation and substitutes the known values (a1=1, a3=1, a98=a99). This is the crux where the sum S is solved as 3. The algebraic steps here are essential, especially showing that a98 - a99 cancels out, leading to S = 2a1 + a3.

The verification in paragraph 6, although reassuring, might be less critical, but the conclusion that S=3 is key. The final answer is derived here, so keeping the final steps where S is calculated is necessary.

Throughout, the key equations and substitutions, especially those involving the sum S and the given conditions, are essential. The parts where the recurrence is applied to the sum and the algebraic manipulation leading to S=3 are the most important for future reasoning.
