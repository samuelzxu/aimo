Okay, I need to determine which parts of the reasoning are essential for future steps. The user wants me to wrap key tokens in <keep> tags. Let's go through each paragraph.

1. The first paragraph introduces the problem of finding the geometric median. It mentions that the geometric median is different from the centroid and requires iterative methods. Key here is the initial problem setup and the mention of geometric median. So, keep that.

2. The next paragraph checks if any given points are the median. The user calculates distances from each Pi to others. The results show P3 has the smallest sum. These calculated sums are important for comparison later.

3. Clarification about whether the sum includes the distance to itself. The ambiguity in the problem statement is addressed here. This is crucial because it affects the sum calculation.

4. Recalculating sums for each Pi including self-distance. The results here show P3's sum is around 45.02. This is key data.

5. Considering the centroid. The centroid's coordinates and sum calculation are compared to P3. The centroid's sum is higher, so ruling it out is important.

6. Introducing Weiszfeld's algorithm. The first iteration from the centroid is detailed. The resulting coordinates and sum are vital as they show a lower sum than P3.

7. Subsequent iterations of Weiszfeld's algorithm show decreasing sums. Each iteration's result shows progress towards the geometric median.

8. Calculating the gradient at P3. The analysis shows the sum of unit vectors isn't zero, implying P3 isn't the median. This reasoning is essential.

9. Trying other points like (6,8) and (5,10) and their sums. These results challenge the assumption that P3 is optimal.

10. Final conclusion balancing competition expectations and calculations, leading to the answer (5,15). Even with contradictions, this part is critical for the final answer.
