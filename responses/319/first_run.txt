Okay, let me start by understanding the problem. We need to find the sum S from n=0 to 22 of 1/(1 + z^n + z^{2n}), where z is a 23rd root of unity not equal to 1. 

First, I remember that z^23 = 1, so z is a primitive 23rd root of unity. The sum includes terms where z^n cycles through all 23rd roots of unity as n varies. When n=0, z^0 = 1, so that term is 1/3. For other n values (1 to 22), z^n are the non-1 roots.

I recall that 1 + z^n + z^{2n} can be written as (z^{3n} - 1)/(z^n - 1) when z^n ≠ 1. This might help transform the sum. So, each term for n ≠ 0 becomes (z^n - 1)/(z^{3n} - 1). 

Next, since 3 and 23 are coprime, the mapping k = 3n mod 23 is a bijection. This means that as n runs from 1 to 22, k also runs through 1 to 22. Substituting n with 8k (since 3*8 ≡ 1 mod 23), the sum becomes a sum over k of (z^{8k} - 1)/(z^k - 1).

Expanding (z^{8k} - 1)/(z^k - 1) as a geometric series gives the sum from m=0 to 7 of z^{km}. Swapping the order of summation, this becomes summing over m and then k. 

For each m, the sum over k of z^{km} for k=1 to 22 can be evaluated using properties of roots of unity. For m=0, it's 22. For m=1 to 7, each sum is -1. Adding these gives 22 - 7 = 15.

Finally, adding the n=0 term (1/3) gives the total sum as 15 + 1/3 = 46/3.

- Paragraph 1, Sentence 3: <keep>Let me recall that for roots of unity, especially primitive ones, we can use properties like their sum over the group or certain symmetries to evaluate such sums.</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 1: <keep>First, since z is a primitive 23rd root of unity, we know that z^23 = 1, so every power of z cycles every 23 steps.</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 3: <keep>But z ≠ 1, so we are dealing with a primitive 23rd root.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 1: <keep>So in this sum, the first term (n=0) is 1/[1 + 1 +1] = 1/3.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 2: <keep>The other terms are 1 divided by (1 + z^n + z^{2n}) where z^n ≠1.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 2: <keep>Wait, I can note that (z^3n -1)/(z^n -1) = z^{2n} + z^n +1.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 3: <keep>Therefore, 1/(1 + z^n + z^{2n}) = (z^n -1)/(z^{3n} -1).</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 2: <keep>But 23 is prime, so 3n≡0 mod23 implies n≡0 mod23, but n ranges from 0 to22, so only n=0, which would give z^{0} =1.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 1: <keep>Thus, substitutingk, we get S can be rewritten.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 3: <keep>Therefore, sum over n=0 to22 of sum_{n=0}^{22} (z^n -1)/(z^{3n}-1) equals:</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 1: <keep>sum_{n=1}^{22} (z^{n} -1)/(z^{3n}-1)} becomes sum_{k=1}^{22} (z^{8k} -1)/(z^{k} -1 ).</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 2: <keep>Now, factor (z^{8k} -1)/(z^k -1) sum_{m=0}^{7} z^{km} as above.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 3: <keep>Thus, sum becomes sum_{k=1}^{22} sum_{m=0}^7 z^{km}=sum_{m=0}^{7} sum_{k=1}^{22}z^{km}.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 1: <keep>For m=0, sum overk=1..22 of z^{0}=22</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 2: <keep>For m=1 to7, prime with23, so sum overk=1..22 z^{km}.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 4: <keep>Thus, for m=0: sum_{k=1}^{22} 1=22. For m=1,...,7, sum_{k=1}^{22} z^{mk}= -1.</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 5: <keep>Thus, the total sum:</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 6: <keep>sum_{m=0}^{7} sum_{k=1}^{22} z^{mk}= (22) + sum_{m=1}^7 (-1)=22 +7*(-1)=22 -7=15.</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 1: <keep>Original S =1/3 + sum_{n=1}^{22}1/(1+z^n +z^{2n})=1/3 +15=1/3+45/3=46/3≈15.333...</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, sum_{ω∈μ23}1/(1 + ω + ω2 }=1/3 +15=46/3≈15.333.</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 2: <keep>But answer is expected to be in box... 46/3 is 15.333... but I thought answer must be an integer? Because sums over roots tend to be rational or integers.</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentence 1: <keep>But here zn is a 23rd root of unity and23 is prime, that would require that (zn )3=1, yet (zn )23=1.</keep>
- Paragraph 12, Sentence 3: <keep>But since zn has order =23/ gcd(n,23). Since23 is prime, and zn≠1, so n≠0, sozn has prime order 23, since gcd(n,23)=1 or23.</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 1: <keep>Thus accept46/3 as answer.</keep>
- Paragraph 14, Sentence 1: <keep>\boxed{\dfrac{46}{3}}</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 2: <keep>But regardless, in the sum, n goes from 0 to 22. For each n, z^n cycles through all the 23rd roots of unity, including 1.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 3: <keep>If z is a primitive 23rd root of unity, then z^n =1 iff n is a multiple of 23. But since we are only taking n=0 to 22, z^n is 1 only when n=0.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 4: <keep>But when n=0, 1 + z^0 + z^{0} =3.</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 1: <keep>But since z is a primitive 23rd root of unity, z^{3n} cycles through all the 23rd roots of unity as n ranges from 0 to22.</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 2: <keep>Thus, substitutingk, we get S can be rewritten.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 4: <keep>For m=0: sum_{k=1}^{22} z^{0*k}=sum_{k=1}^{22}1=22.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 5: <keep>For m=1,...,7: sum_{k=1}^{22}z^{mk}=sum_{k=0}^{22} z^{mk} -1=0 -1=-1.</keep>
