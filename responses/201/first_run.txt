Okay, I need to figure out which parts of the reasoning are essential for solving the problem and determine the maximum possible value of \( x_2 \). Let's go through the thought process step by step.

First, the problem defines \( a_i \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq 215 \) as \( \frac{1}{2^i} \) and \( a_{216} = \frac{1}{2^{215}} \). The constraints are that the sum of all \( x_i \) is 1, and there's a given equation involving the sum of products of \( x_i \) and \( x_j \), which gets transformed using algebraic identities.

The key step here is recognizing the identity for the square of the sum of \( x_i \), leading to an equation that relates the sum of \( x_i^2 \) and the given quadratic form. By substituting the given equation into this identity, we derive an expression involving \( \sum x_i^2 / (1 - a_i) \), which simplifies to \( 1/215 \).

Using Lagrange multipliers to maximize \( x_2 \) subject to the constraints, we set up the Lagrangian and find the partial derivatives. This leads to expressions for \( x_i \) in terms of constants derived from the multipliers. For \( i \neq 2 \), \( x_i \) is proportional to \( (1 - a_i) \), while \( x_2 \) has a different proportionality due to its role in the maximization.

Solving the resulting quadratic equations reveals that the critical point for \( x_2 \) is \( 3/860 \), which satisfies all constraints. Additionally, applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality confirms that the equality condition holds when all \( x_i \) are proportional to \( (1 - a_i) \), reinforcing that \( x_2 = 3/860 \) is indeed the maximum possible value under the given constraints.

The essential tokens here include the definitions of \( a_i \), the transformation of the given equation using algebraic identities, the derivation of the sum involving \( x_i^2 \), the application of Lagrange multipliers, solving the quadratic equation for \( k \), and the verification using Cauchy-Schwarz. These steps are crucial as they form the backbone of the optimization process and confirm the solution's validity.
