Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to find the surface generated by the solutions of the given differential equation that intersects the specified circle. Hmm, the equation is \(\frac{dx}{yz} = \frac{dy}{zx} = \frac{dz}{xy}\). Alright, this is a system of differential equations, so I should look for first integrals.

First, taking the ratios of \(dx/yz\) and \(dy/zx\), cross-multiplying gives \(x dx = y dy\). Integrating this leads to \(x^2 - y^2 = C\), a constant. That's one first integral. Next, using the ratios \(dy/zx\) and \(dz/xy\), similar steps give \(y^2 - z^2 = D\). So these two equations define the solution curves.

Now, considering the initial circle \(y^2 + z^2 = 1\) at \(x = 0\), substituting \(x=0\) into the first integrals gives \(C = -y^2\) and \(D = 2y^2 -1\). Relating \(C\) and \(D\) eliminates \(y^2\), leading to \(D + 2C +1 =0\). Substituting \(C = x^2 - y^2\) and \(D = y^2 - z^2\) into this relation, simplifying yields \(y^2 + z^2 -2x^2 =1\). 

Checking consistency: At \(x=0\), it matches the circle. The direction vector from the DE is tangent to this surface, confirming it's the correct integral surface. So the answer is \(\boxed{y^2 + z^2 - 2x^2 =1}\).

- Paragraph 1, Sentence 1: <keep>Find the surface generated by the solutions of \[ \frac {dx}{yz} = \frac {dy}{zx} = \frac{dz}{xy}, \] which intersects the circle  $y^2+ z^2 = 1, x = 0.$</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 1: <keep>First, let me recall that when dealing with equations of the form \(\frac{dx}{P} = \frac{dy}{Q} = \frac{dz}{R}\), one common approach is to find two independent first integrals, which are functions that remain constant along the solutions.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 1: <keep>Given the system:
\[
\frac{dx}{yz} = \frac{dy}{zx} = \frac{dz}{xy}
\]
So here, \(P = yz\), \(Q = zx\), and \(R = xy\).</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 1: <keep>So, from the first two fractions: \(\frac{dx}{yz} = \frac{dy}{zx}\)</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 3: <keep>Integrate both sides:
\(\frac{1}{2}x^2 + C_1 = \frac{1}{2}y^2 + C_2\)</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 1: <keep>\(x^2 - y^2 = C\)</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 1: <keep>Cross-multiplying:
\(xy \, dy = zx \, dz\)
Cancel x (assuming x ≠ 0):
\(y \, dy = z \, dz\)</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 1: <keep>Integrate:
\(\frac{1}{2}y^2 = \frac{1}{2}z^2 + C_3\)</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 1: <keep>\(y^2 - z^2 = D\), where D = 2C3.</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 1: <keep>Thus, integrating, we have u - v = C, v - w = D, so two first integrals from u, v, w. But since u = x2, etc., so x2 - y2 = C and y2 - z2 = D.</keep>
- Paragraph 14, Sentence 1: <keep>Hence, the solutions are the curves formed by these intersections.</keep>
- Paragraph 16, Sentence 1: <keep>From x2 - y2 = C,
0 - y2 = C => C = - y2.</keep>
- Paragraph 16, Sentence 2: <keep>Similarly, from y2 - z2 = D,
D = y2 - z2.</keep>
- Paragraph 17, Sentence 1: <keep>But on the circle y2 + z2 =1, so z2 =1 - y2, hence:
D = y2 - (1 - y2) = 2 y2 -1.</keep>
- Paragraph 18, Sentence 1: <keep>So the relation between the two constants is D + 2C +1=0.</keep>
- Paragraph 19, Sentence 1: <keep>Substituting \(C = x^2 - y^2\) and \(D = y^2 - z^2\) into the equation D + 2C +1=0, we get:
(y2 - z2) + 2(x2 - y2) +1 =0</keep>
- Paragraph 19, Sentence 2: <keep>Combine like terms:
2x2 - y2 - z2 +1= 0</keep>
- Paragraph 22, Sentence 1: <keep>Hence, the surface is 2x2 - y2 - z2 +1 =0 ⇒ 2x2 = y2 + z2 -1.</keep>
- Paragraph 23, Sentence 1: <keep>Wait, when x=0, we have 0 = y2 + z2 -1, which is exactly the given circle y2 + z2 =1.</keep>
- Paragraph 25, Sentence 1: <keep>The surface is 2x2 - y2 - z2 = -1 ⇒ y2 + z2 -2x2=1.</keep>
- Paragraph 27, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, the solution surface is the hyperboloid y2 + z2 -2x2=1.</keep>
- Paragraph 31, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, the surface generated by the solutions is exactly that hyperboloid. Also, as the hyperboloid contains the initial circle at x=0, this confirms that it is the correct surface.</keep>
