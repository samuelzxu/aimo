Okay, let's figure out where to place the <keep> tags. The user wants the essential tokens for future reasoning steps. Looking at the Deepseek Thinking Trajectory:

1. **Initial Problem Understanding**: The problem involves finding resonance frequency with given parameters and then calculating a specific expression. The key parameters are R, t, ρ_b, Y, and the hint about bending vs stretching is crucial.

2. **Key Steps Identified**:
   - The mention of bending mode resonance and why it's important (lower energy).
   - Flexural rigidity D and its relation to Y and t.
   - Dimensional analysis steps where units are broken down and exponents solved.
   - The derivation leading to ω proportional to sqrt(Y t² / (ρ_b R⁴)).
   - Calculation of exponents a, b, c, d and the final expression 4a² + 3b² + 2c² + d².

3. **Critical Parts to Retain**:
   - The conclusion that a = -2, b = 1, c = -1/2, d = 1/2.
   - The calculation steps for each term in the final expression.
   - The final result of 79/4.

Now, I'll go through the trajectory and mark the essential parts. Each <keep> block should capture necessary reasoning steps or conclusions without redundant details.

Examples from the text:

- Paragraph explaining the natural frequency formula involving D, μ, and R.
- Dimensional analysis steps leading to exponents a, b, c, d.
- Substitution steps converting D and μ into the formula for ω.
- Final exponent values and the calculation of 4a² + 3b² + 2c² + d².

Each marked section should be at least one sentence or phrase, not altering the original text.
