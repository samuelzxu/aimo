Alright, let's break down the key elements needed to solve this problem. The question involves particles passing through a filter and slit, resulting in diffraction patterns. We need to find the ratio T1/T2 based on given angles for the first and second bright regions.

First, the de Broglie wavelength λ is related to the particles' mass and temperature. The average speed of particles from a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is v_avg = sqrt(8k_BT/(πm)), so the wavelength λ = h/(m*v) becomes λ = h/sqrt((8k_BTm)/π). This gives λ proportional to 1/sqrt(Tm).

For single-slit diffraction, the secondary maxima positions are approximated by a*sinθ ≈ (n + 1/2)λ. The first experiment (mass m1, temperature T1) has the first bright region at θ1 = 15°, and the second experiment (mass m2=2m1, temperature T2) has the second bright region at θ2 = 20°. Using the positions of the maxima:

1. For the first experiment: a*sinθ1 ≈ 1.4303λ1
2. For the second experiment: a*sinθ2 ≈ 2.4590λ2

Taking the ratio of wavelengths and solving for T1/T2:

λ1/λ2 = [a*sinθ1/1.4303] / [a*sinθ2/2.4590] = (2.4590/1.4303)*(sin15°/sin20°) ≈ 1.719*(0.2588/0.3420) ≈ 1.30

From the relationship λ1/λ2 = sqrt(2T2/T1), squaring gives (1.30)² = 2T2/T1 → T1/T2 ≈ 1.18. However, the closest answer provided is 1.3 (B). This discrepancy might stem from rounding or approximations in the problem setup.
