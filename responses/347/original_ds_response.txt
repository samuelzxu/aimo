Okay, so we're dealing with a physics problem here, and I need to figure out the ratio of T1 to T2. Let me try to understand the situation first.

First, there are non-relativistic particles coming from a source at a certain temperature, T1. These particles go through a filter that selects only those with speeds close to the average speed of all the particles from the source. After filtering, they pass through a slit of width 2.5 micrometers. On the observation screen, there are bright and dark regions, like an interference or diffraction pattern. The first bright region closest to the center is at 15 degrees. Then, they repeat the experiment with a different source: particles with mass m2 = 2*m1 and temperature T2. Now, the second bright region is at 20 degrees. The question is asking for the ratio T1/T2.

Alright, so let's start recalling what I know about diffraction patterns. For single-slit diffraction, the dark fringes occur at angles given by the equation:

a * sin(theta) = n * lambda

where:
- a is the slit width,
- theta is the angle from the central maximum,
- n is the order of the dark fringe (n = 1, 2, 3, ...),
- lambda is the wavelength of the wave.

Wait, but here they mention bright and dark regions. Hmm, actually, in single-slit diffraction, the central maximum is bright and the dark fringes are the minima. But sometimes people might refer to the bright regions as the secondary maxima between the dark fringes. The positions of these secondary maxima are not exactly given by the simple formula for dark fringes but rather by more complex calculations. However, for small angles, we can approximate the positions.

Wait, but the problem states that the first bright region closest to the center is at 15 degrees. So, in single-slit diffraction, the first minimum (dark fringe) is at an angle theta given by a*sin(theta) = lambda. The next minimum is at a*sin(theta) = 2*lambda, etc. The bright regions, the maxima, lie approximately halfway between the minima. But I might have to think again here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is actually referring to a double-slit interference pattern? But no, it says a single slit. Or maybe the problem is using a diffraction grating? Wait, no, it's a single slit. Let me confirm.

In single-slit diffraction, the central maximum is very broad, and the intensity decreases with increasing angle. The first minimum occurs at a*sin(theta) = lambda, the second at a*sin(theta) = 2*lambda, etc. The secondary maxima between them are not exactly at the halfway points. But perhaps the problem simplifies this and treats the bright regions as occurring at some approximate positions?

Alternatively, maybe it's using the same formula as the minima but shifted. The problem mentions that it's the first bright region closest to the center. The central maximum is brightest at theta = 0, and the first dark spot is at theta = arcsin(lambda/a). Then, perhaps the first secondary maximum is approximately at 1.43 lambda/a, according to some approximations?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is treating this as a double-slit interference where the bright fringes are given by d*sin(theta) = n*lambda. But no, since it's a single slit, diffraction applies here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is incorrectly using "bright regions" instead of dark regions? Maybe the question has a mistake? But the user says bright and dark regions are observed, with the first bright one closest to the center at 15 degrees, so likely this is referring to the central peak plus secondary maxima.

So, perhaps they are considering the secondary maxima's positions. Let me check the exact positions. For single-slit diffraction, the intensity is given by the square of the sinc function. The minima (dark fringes) occur at a*sin(theta) = n*lambda, where n = 1,2,3,...

But the positions of the maxima (bright fringes) aren't exactly halfway between the minima. They are slightly shifted. The first secondary maximum occurs approximately at a*sin(theta) ≈ 1.4303*lambda, the next at ≈ 2.4590*lambda, and so on.

But if the problem says the first bright region closest to the center is at 15 degrees, maybe they are using an approximation, perhaps naively considering maxima as lambda/a, 2*lambda/a, etc., similar to double-slit, but that would contradict standard physics. Alternatively, maybe the problem is incorrectly using the formula, or there might be a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the experiment isn't diffraction but some other form of interference.

Wait, actually, particles here are being diffracted through a slit. So this is particle diffraction, which is similar to wave diffraction. The de Broglie wavelength would come into play here. So particles have a wavelength lambda = h / p, where p is the momentum.

Okay, so de Broglie wavelength lambda = h / (m*v), where h is Planck's constant, m is mass, and v is velocity.

In the first case, mass m1, temperature T1. The particles are filtered to have speeds close to the average speed. The average speed for a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is v_avg = sqrt(8*k_B*T/(pi*m)), I think. Let me remember: for a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, the average speed is sqrt(8*k_B*T/(pi*m)), the root mean square speed is sqrt(3*k_B*T/m), and the most probable speed is sqrt(2*k_B*T/m). The problem says the filter selects only those particles that have speed close to the average. So, after the filter, the particles have speed approximately equal to v1_avg = sqrt(8*k_B*T1/(pi*m1)).

Similarly, in the second case, the particles have mass m2=2m1, temperature T2, and after filtering, their speed is v2_avg = sqrt(8*k_B*T2/(pi*m2)) = sqrt(8*k_B*T2/(pi*2m1)).

Okay, so their de Broglie wavelengths would be:

lambda1 = h/(m1*v1_avg) = h/(m1*sqrt(8*k_B*T1/(pi*m1))) = h / sqrt(8*k_B*T1*m1/pi)

Similarly, lambda2 = h/(m2*v2_avg) = h/(2m1*sqrt(8*k_B*T2/(pi*2m1))) = h / (2m1 * sqrt(8*k_B*T2/(pi*2m1))) = h / (sqrt( (2m1)^2 * (8*k_B*T2) / (pi*2m1) )) )) )

Wait, let's compute this step by step.

v2_avg = sqrt(8*k_B*T2/(pi*m2)) = sqrt(8*k_B*T2/(pi*2m1))

Then lambda2 = h/(m2*v2_avg) = h/(2m1 * sqrt(8k_B T2/(pi*2m1))) )

So, lambda2: numerator h, denominator 2m1 * sqrt(8k_B T2/(pi*2m1))

Simplify denominator:

sqrt(8k_B T2/(pi*2m1)) = sqrt(4k_B T2/(pi*m1)) = 2*sqrt(k_B T2/(pi*m1))

So denominator is 2m1 * 2*sqrt(k_B T2/(pi*m1)) ) = 4m1*sqrt(k_B T2/(pi*m1))

Therefore, lambda2 = h/(4m1*sqrt(k_B T2/(pi*m1))) )

Let me see, similarly, for lambda1:

lambda1 = h/(m1 * sqrt(8k_B T1/(pi m1)) )) = h/( sqrt(8k_B T1 m1^2/(pi m1)) )) = h/( sqrt(8k_B T1 m1 / pi) )) )

Similarly sqrt(8k_B T1 m1 / pi) is sqrt( (8/pi) k_B T1 m1 )

So lambda1 = h / sqrt( (8/pi) k_B T1 m1 )

Similarly, lambda2 = h / (4m1 * sqrt(k_B T2/(pi m1)) )) ?

Wait, let's see again. For lambda1:

v1_avg = sqrt(8k_B T1/(pi m1))

lambda1 = h/(m1 * v1_avg) = h/(m1 * sqrt(8k_B T1/(pi m1)) )

= h / ( sqrt( m1^2 * 8k_B T1/(pi m1) ) )

= h / sqrt( 8k_B T1 m1^2/(pi m1) )

= h / sqrt(8k_B T1 m1 / pi )

Similarly, lambda2:

lambda2 = h/(m2 * v2_avg) ) = h/(2m1) * 1/ ( sqrt(8k_B T2/(pi*2m1)) )

= h/(2m1) * 1/( sqrt(8k_B T2/(2 pi m1)) )

= h/(2m1) ) * sqrt(2 pi m1/(8k_B T2) )

= h/(2m1) ) * sqrt( pi m1/(4k_B T2) )

= h/(2m1) * sqrt(pi m1)/(2 sqrt(k_B T2)) )

= h * sqrt(pi m1) / (4 m1 sqrt(k_B T2) )

= h sqrt(pi) / (4 m1^{1/2} sqrt(k_B T2) )

Similarly, compute lambda1 expression:

lambda1 = h / sqrt(8k_B T1 m1 / pi ) = h sqrt(pi) / sqrt(8 k_B T1 m1 )

= h sqrt(pi) / ( sqrt(8) sqrt(k_B T1) sqrt(m1) )

= h sqrt(pi) / ( 2 sqrt(2) sqrt(k_B T1 m1 ) )

Alternatively, express lambda1 and lambda2 in terms of each other. Hmm. Maybe compute lambda1 / lambda2. Let's see:

Let me compute lambda1 / lambda2:

lambda1 / lambda2 = [ h sqrt(pi) / sqrt(8k_B T1 m1 ) ] / [ h sqrt(pi) / (4 m1^{1/2} sqrt(k_B T2) ) ]

Wait, hold on. Wait, maybe compute each expression more carefully.

Let me write expressions for lambda1 and lambda2:

lambda1 = h / [ sqrt( (8/pi) k_B T1 m1 ) ]

lambda2 is as we calculated:

lambda2 = [ h sqrt(pi) / (4 sqrt(m1) sqrt(k_B T2) ) ]

So lambda1 = h / [ sqrt(8/pi) sqrt(k_B T1 m1) ) ] = h / [ sqrt(8/pi) sqrt(k_B T1) sqrt(m1) ) ]

So lambda1 = h * sqrt(pi) / [ sqrt(8) sqrt(k_B T1) sqrt(m1) ) ]

Similarly, lambda2 is:

lambda2 = h sqrt(pi) / (4 sqrt(m1) sqrt(k_B T2) )

Then, lambda1 / lambda2 = [ h sqrt(pi)/sqrt(8) sqrt(k_B T1) sqrt(m1) ) ] / [ h sqrt(pi) / (4 sqrt(m1) sqrt(k_B T2) ) ]

Wait, no, wait. Actually, lambda1 = numerator / denominator, lambda2 = numerator / denominator. Let's proceed:

lambda1 = h * sqrt(pi) / [ sqrt(8) sqrt(k_B T1) sqrt(m1) ) ]

lambda2 = h * sqrt(pi) / [4 sqrt(m1) sqrt(k_B T2) ) ]

Therefore, lambda1 / lambda2 = [ h sqrt(pi) / (sqrt(8) sqrt(k_B T1) sqrt(m1)) ) ] / [ h sqrt(pi) / (4 sqrt(m1) sqrt(k_B T2)) ) ]

Simplify this:

= [1 / (sqrt(8) sqrt(k_B T1) sqrt(m1)) ] / [ 1 / (4 sqrt(m1) sqrt(k_B T2)) )

Invert denominator and multiply:

= [1 / (sqrt(8) sqrt(k_B T1) sqrt(m1)) ] * [4 sqrt(m1) sqrt(k_B T2) / 1 ]

Simplify terms:

The sqrt(m1) in the denominator cancels with sqrt(m1) in numerator:

= 4 sqrt(k_B T2) / (sqrt(8) sqrt(k_B T1) )

sqrt(8) is 2 sqrt(2), so:

= 4 sqrt(k_B T2) / (2 sqrt(2) sqrt(k_B T1) )

Which simplifies:

= (4 / (2 sqrt(2)) ) * sqrt( T2 / T1 )

= (2 / sqrt(2)) ) * sqrt( T2 / T1 )

But 2 / sqrt(2) = sqrt(2), so:

= sqrt(2) * sqrt( T2 / T1 )

= sqrt(2 T2 / T1 )

Therefore:

lambda1 / lambda2 = sqrt(2 T2 / T1 )

So lambda1 = lambda2 * sqrt(2 T2 / T1 )

Alternatively,

lambda1 / lambda2 = sqrt(2 T2 / T1 )

Which means:

sqrt( T1 / T2 ) = lambda2 / lambda1 * sqrt(2)

Hence,

T1 / T2 = 2 (lambda2 / lambda1)^2

But we want T1 / T2, so we need to relate lambda1 and lambda2. Let me remember the angles given.

The problem states that in the first experiment, the first bright region (closest to the center) is at 15 degrees. In the second experiment, the second bright region is at 20 degrees. Wait, is that right?

Wait, for the first setup: m = m1, T = T1, slit a = 2.5 micrometers. Theta1 = 15 degrees for the first bright region.

Second setup: m2 = 2m1, T2, same slit width, the second bright region is at 20 degrees. Need to relate these angles to lambda1 and lambda2.

Assuming that the positions of the bright regions in single-slit diffraction correspond to the secondary maxima. As mentioned earlier, the first secondary maximum is approximately at a*sin(theta) ≈ 1.4303*lambda, the second one at ≈ 2.4590*lambda.

But the problem might be using a simplified model where it treats the bright regions at the same positions as the double-slit maxima, i.e., a*sin(theta) = (n + 0.5) * lambda, but even that may not be precise. Alternatively, maybe they are using a very rough approximation. Alternatively, given that the problem doesn't specify, perhaps it's safer to use the standard single-slit minima formula but for bright regions. Wait, perhaps the question is using the same formula as for double-slit? Maybe miscopying.

Wait, the problem says "bright and dark regions," which suggests diffraction, but in double-slit you have both interference and diffraction. Hmm, perhaps there's an alternative approach. Let me check.

If we consider the slit as a single slit, standard single-slit diffraction applies. However, the presence of bright and dark regions (with the first bright closest to center at 15 degrees) suggests that maybe the first bright after the central maximum. But perhaps in the problem, they take this as the first maximum, hence using an approximate formula. Since the first minimum is at a*sin(theta) = lambda, but then the first secondary maximum might be given by an approximate formula such as a*sin(theta) ≈ (3/2)*lambda. Let me confirm.

Yes, in some introductory treatments, they approximate that the secondary maxima occur approximately midway between the minima. Since the first minima are at n=1,2,..., the position midway between n=1 and n=2 would be at a*sin(theta) = (3/2)*lambda. Therefore, maybe they are using this for the first secondary maximum.

Wait, according to some sources, the secondary maxima in single-slit diffraction occur at approximately a*sin(theta) ≈ (n + 1/2)*lambda, where n = 1,2,3,...

If so, then the first secondary maximum (n=1) would be at a*sin(theta) = 3/2 * lambda

The second (n=2) would be at a*sin(theta) = 5/2 * lambda

But in reality, these are just approximations. The exact positions as per the intensity formula are zeroes of the derivative of the sinc squared function. However, for the purposes of this problem, maybe they are using the approximate formula a*sin(theta) = (n + 1/2)*lambda.

Alternatively, they could be considering Fraunhofer diffraction where the angle theta is given by a*sin(theta) = n*lambda for minima, and maxima are in between.

But the problem differs in the two experiments. In the first case, the first bright region (probably first secondary maximum) is at 15 degrees. In the second experiment, with different parameters, the second bright region is at 20 degrees.

So in the first case: a*sin(theta1) = 1.43*lambda1 (approximate first secondary maximum)

But the problem might be assuming that theta is small and sin(theta) ~ theta in radians. However, 15 degrees is about 0.2618 radians, 20 degrees is about 0.349 radians. So the small angle approximation may not hold exactly, but since the problem doesn't specify, it's probably expecting using sin(theta) without approximation.

So I need to relate the angles, the slit width, and the wavelength (so via de Broglie's relation to the velocity, hence T and m).

Let's take a step-by-step approach.

First, find expressions for the two angles given in the problem in terms of the de Broglie wavelengths.

First case: first bright region at 15 degrees, n=1.

If the problem uses the approximate formula for secondary maxima: a*sin(theta) ≈ (n + 1/2) * lambda. For the first secondary maximum: n=1? Wait, actually, if the central maximum is considered the zeroth, then the first secondary maxima is n=1. Wait, but this is conflicting with standard definitions. Let me check.

In single-slit diffraction, the central maximum is the zeroth order. The first secondary maximum is next, then another. The formula for the position is approx a*sin(theta) ≈ (n + 1/2) * lambda, where n=1,2,...

Alternatively, sometimes referred as the m-th maximum where m=1 is first. But let me check typical values.

Alternatively, more accurately, from hyperphysics: http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/phyopt/sinint.html#c1

The first secondary maximum occurs at approximate beta = (3/2) pi, which corresponds to alpha = (3/2) pi / (pi) * (a/lambda) sin(theta) = (3/2).

Wait, the condition for minima is a sin(theta) = m lambda, m=1,2,...

The approximate positions for the maxima of the single-slit diffraction are at:

a sin(theta) = (m + 1/2) lambda, m=1,2,...

But according to hyperphysics, the exact values are:

First secondary maximum: a sin(theta) ≈ 1.4303 lambda

Second secondary maximum: a sin(theta) ≈ 2.4590 lambda

Third: ~3.4707, etc.

Thus, the first secondary maximum is at a sin(theta) ≈ 1.4303 lambda

Second: ~2.4590 lambda

Third: ~3.4707 lambda, etc.

But the problem says "the first bright region closest to the center" - so that's the first secondary maximum (just next to the central peak). Similarly, for the second experiment, the "second bright region" is probably the second secondary maximum, which occurs at approximately 2.4590 lambda.

However, since the problem is giving angles, the exact value may depend on using these approximate factors. Therefore, for each experiment:

First experiment:

theta1 = 15 degrees (first secondary maximum) ⇒ a sin(theta1) ≈ 1.4303 lambda1

Second experiment:

theta2 = 20 degrees (second secondary maximum) ⇒ a sin(theta2) ≈ 2.4590 lambda2

Given that the slit width 'a' is the same in both experiments (2.5 micrometers). Therefore, we can write two equations:

a sin(theta1) = 1.4303 lambda1

a sin(theta2) = 2.4590 lambda2

Therefore, we can express lambda1 and lambda2 in terms of a, theta1, theta2:

lambda1 = a sin(theta1) / 1.4303

lambda2 = a sin(theta2) / 2.4590

Then use de Broglie relation, as we earlier found, to relate lambda1 and lambda2 to the temperatures T1 and T2, and masses m1 and m2.

From before, we had expressions for lambda1 and lambda2 in terms of T1, T2, m1, m2.

Recall:

lambda1 = h / sqrt( (8 / pi) k_B T1 m1 )

Similarly, since m2 = 2m1,

lambda2 = h / sqrt( (8 / pi) k_B T2 m2 ) = h / sqrt( (8 / pi) k_B T2 * 2 m1 )

Therefore, lambda2 = h / sqrt( (16 / pi) k_B T2 m1 )

So let's compute the ratio lambda1 / lambda2:

lambda1 / lambda2 = [ h / sqrt( (8 / pi) k_B T1 m1 ) ] / [ h / sqrt( (16 / pi) k_B T2 m1 ) ) ] = sqrt( (16 / pi k_B T2 m1 ) / (8 / pi k_B T1 m1 ) )

Simplify inside the sqrt:

Numerator: (16 / pi k_B T2 m1 )

Denominator: (8 / pi k_B T1 m1 )

So divide:

= (16 / (8)) * (T1 / T2 ) )

= 2 * (T1 / T2 )

Thus,

lambda1 / lambda2 = sqrt( 2 * (T1 / T2 ) )

Therefore, (lambda1 / lambda2)^2 = 2 T1 / T2 → T1 / T2 = (lambda1^2 / lambda2^2) / 2

Alternatively:

From lambda1 / lambda2 = sqrt(2T1 / T2 )

Wait, substituting:

Wait, correcting:

Wait actually inside the sqrt the operation:

(16 / (...)) / (8 / (...)) would be:

= 16/(16 / pi k_B T2 m1) divided by 8/(8 / pi k_B T1 m1)

Wait, wait:

Wait, perhaps better:

lambda1 / lambda2 = sqrt( ( (16/pi) k_B T2 m1 ) / ( (8 / pi) k_B T1 m1 ) )

Wait no.

Wait, step by step.

We're dealing with:

lambda1 = h / sqrt( (8/pi) k_B T1 m1 )

lambda2 = h / sqrt( (16/pi) k_B T2 m1 )

Thus, lambda1 / lambda2 = [ h / sqrt( (8/pi)k_B T1 m1 ) ] / [ h / sqrt( (16/pi)k_B T2 m1 ) ]

= sqrt( (16/pi k_B T2 m1 ) ) / sqrt( (8/pi k_B T1 m1 ) )

= sqrt( (16 / 8 ) * (k_B T2 m1 ) / (k_B T1 m1 ) )

= sqrt( 2 * T2 / T1 )

Therefore, lambda1 / lambda2 = sqrt( 2 T2 / T1 )

Thus,

( lambda1 / lambda2 )^2 = 2 T2 / T1 → T1 / T2 = 2 / ( (lambda1 / lambda2 )^2 )

But from the equations above, we can write lambda1 and lambda2 in terms of theta1 and theta2:

lambda1 = a sin(theta1) / 1.4303

lambda2 = a sin(theta2) / 2.4590

Thus,

lambda1 / lambda2 = [a sin(theta1)/1.4303] / [a sin(theta2)/2.4590] ] = [ sin(theta1)/1.4303 ] / [ sin(theta2)/2.4590 ] = ( sin(theta1) * 2.4590 ) / ( sin(theta2) * 1.4303 )

Therefore,

lambda1 / lambda2 = (2.4590 / 1.4303 ) * ( sin(theta1) / sin(theta2) )

The coefficient 2.4590 / 1.4303 ≈ 1.718 (let me compute: 2.459 / 1.4303

Compute 1.4303*1.7 = 2.43151, which is a bit less than 2.459. Let me calculate more accurately:

2.4590 / 1.4303 ≈ 1.719. Let me use more decimal places:

1.4303 → 1.4303

2.4590 ÷ 1.4303 ≈

Divide: 2.4590 / 1.4303

≈ 2.459 / 1.4303 ≈ (2.459 * 10000 ) / (1.4303 * 10000 )

24590 / 14303 ≈ 1.719 approximately.

So approximately 1.719.

So lambda1 / lambda2 ≈ 1.719 * ( sin(theta1) / sin(theta2) )

From the problem, theta1 is 15 degrees, theta2 is 20 degrees.

Compute sin(theta1) / sin(theta2):

sin(15°) ≈ 0.2588

sin(20°) ≈ 0.3420

Therefore, ratio ≈ 0.2588 / 0.3420 ≈ 0.7567

Therefore, lambda1 / lambda2 ≈ 1.719 * 0.7567 ≈ Let's calculate this.

First, 1.719 * 0.7 ≈ 1.203; 1.719 * 0.05 ≈ 0.08595; 1.719 * 0.0067 ≈ 0.0115. So total approx 1.203 + 0.08595 + 0.0115 ≈ 1.30

So approximately 1.3. Therefore, lambda1 / lambda2 ≈ 1.3.

But we need exact calculation.

First, calculate sin(15°):

sin(15°) = sin(45° - 30° ) = sin45 cos30 - cos45 sin30 = (√2/2)(√3/2) - (√2/2)(1/2) = √2/2*(√3 - 1)/2 = √2*(√3 - 1)/4 ≈ (1.4142*(1.732 - 1))/4 ≈ 1.4142*(0.732)/4 ≈ 1.4142*0.732 ≈ 1.035 / 4 ≈ 0.2588.

sin(20°) = approximately 0.3420201433.

So sin(15°)/sin(20°) ≈ 0.2588 / 0.3420 ≈ 0.7567.

Then, multiplying by 2.4590 / 1.4303:

Let's compute 2.4590 / 1.4303.

Calculate 2.4590 ÷ 1.4303:

1.4303 * 1.7 = 2.43151

Difference: 2.4590 - 2.43151 = 0.02749

0.02749 / 1.4303 ≈ 0.01922

Total: 1.7 + 0.01922 ≈ 1.7192.

Yes. So lambda1 / lambda2 ≈ 1.7192 * 0.7567 ≈ calculate as follows:

1.7192 * 0.7 = 1.20344

1.7192 * 0.05 = 0.08596

1.7192 * 0.0067 ≈ 0.01152

Sum: 1.20344 + 0.08596 ≈ 1.2894 + 0.01152 ≈ 1.3009

Approx 1.301 So approximately lambda1/lambda2 ≈ 1.301

But according to the previous relationship:

lambda1 / lambda2 = sqrt(2 T2 / T1 )

Therefore:

1.301 ≈ sqrt(2 T2 / T1 )

Therefore, squaring both sides:

1.301^2 ≈ 2 T2 / T1 → T2 / T1 ≈ 1.301^2 / 2 ≈ (1.6926) / 2 ≈ 0.8463.

Therefore, T1 / T2 ≈ 1 / 0.8463 ≈ 1.1816.

But this is approximately 1.18. But 1.18 is not among the answer choices. The options are (A) 2.2, (B)1.3, (C)3.5, (D)1.9. Hmm. Wait, something's wrong here. Either my approach is flawed, or perhaps there is an error in my calculation. Let's check each step again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem interprets the first and second bright regions as positions corresponding to the nth minima in a different context? Alternatively, another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to a double-slit interference instead of single-slit diffraction? Let's confirm the original problem statement.

The problem says: "Non-relativistic particles... go through a filter that selects only those particles that have a speed close to the average..., and then they proceed to illuminate a slit of width 2.5 micrometers. On an observation screen... a series of bright and dark regions are observed... the first bright one... located at an angle of 15 degrees."

Therefore, single-slit diffraction. As such, standard single-slit formulas apply.

But the problem states that after passing through the slit, the particles show a diffraction pattern. Then, particles with mass m2 and temperature T2 show their second bright region at 20 degrees.

According to my calculation, the result came out approximately T1 / T2 ≈ 1.18, but none of the given options are near that. The closest is 1.3 (B) or 1.9 (D). So perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, let's check again all steps.

First, relate lambda1 and lambda2 from angles:

Using the positions of the diffraction maxima. For the first experiment, the first bright after the central maximum (first secondary maximum) is at angle theta1 = 15°, corresponds to a sin(theta1) ≈ 1.4303 * lambda1.

For the second experiment, the second bright region is at theta2 = 20°. The question says "the second bright region now appears at 20 degrees." If "second bright region" is the second secondary maximum, which is at a sin(theta2) ≈ 2.4590 * lambda2.

Then my equations are correct:

a sin(theta1) ≈ 1.4303 * lambda1

a sin(theta2) ≈ 2.4590 * lambda2

Thus:

lambda1 = a sin(theta1) / 1.4303

lambda2 = a sin(theta2) / 2.4590

But to be precise, perhaps instead of a=2.5 micrometers, the slit width is the same in both experiments, but that cancels out when taking the ratios.

Therefore, lambda1/lambda2 = [sin(theta1) / 1.4303] / [ sin(theta2) / 2.4590 ] = (2.4590 / 1.4303) * (sin theta1 / sin theta2 )

Calculate it again precisely:

2.4590 divided by 1.4303 is exactly:

2.4590 / 1.4303 = Let's compute this:

1.4303 * 1.7 = 2.431, which is 0.028 less than 2.459. So 1.7 + (0.0272)/1.4303 ≈ 1.7 + 0.019 ≈ 1.719. So it's approximately 1.719.

Sine values:

sin(15°) = 0.2588

sin(20°) = 0.3420

Ratio: 0.2588 / 0.3420 = 0.7564.

Then, 1.719 * 0.7564 ≈ Let's compute: 1.7 * 0.7564 = 1.28588; 0.019 * 0.7564 ≈ 0.01437. Summing: 1.28588 + 0.01437≈1.30025.

So yeah, lambda1/lambda2≈1.30025

From above, we have this ratio equal to sqrt( 2 T2 / T1 ). So,

1.30025 ≈ sqrt(2 T2/T1 )

Square both sides: (1.30025)^2 ≈ 1.6907 ≈ 2 T2 / T1

Thus,

T1/T2 ≈ 2 / 1.6907 ≈ 1.182.

Still, this gives ≈1.18, which is not among the options. The possible answers are 2.2,1.3,3.5,1.9. This suggests that perhaps my approximations for the position of maxima are not what is intended. Alternatively, perhaps considering the angles for minima instead of maxima.

Wait, let's suppose that the problem wrongly use the formula for minima. That is, they might be considering the first bright as corresponding to the first minimum, but it's dark... Perhaps incorrect. Alternatively, if it's a double-slit experiment...

Wait, if it was a double-slit interference, then the formula for maxima is d sin(theta) = n lambda, where d is the slit separation. However, in a single-slit, it's different.

Alternatively, if the problem is mistaking the bright fringes for the same formula as double-slit maxima, assuming d sin(theta)=n lambda.

But according to that, for the first case n=1 (first maximum), theta1=15 degrees.

Second case, second maximum n=2 at theta2=20 degrees.

If that's the case, then the formulas would be different.

But then, in single-slit, those would be for minima.

But let's say regardless, perhaps they're using the maxima formula wrongly. For example, if they took a sin(theta)=n lambda for maxima, but in reality it's for minima.

If that's the case, then First experiment:

a sin(theta1) = 1 * lambda1

theta1=15 degrees

Second experiment:

a sin(theta2) = 2 * lambda2 (since second bright region, n=2)

But given this wrong assumption, then:

Therefore, lambda1= a sin(theta1)=2.5 micrometers * sin(15°)

Similarly, lambda2= a sin(theta2)/2.

But given that slit width a is 2.5 micrometers.

But a=2.5 micrometers=2.5e-6 meters.

However, the problem says:

"In the first case, theta1=15 degrees...Second bright region now appears at 20 degrees."

Wait. Wait, correction: in first case, filter selects particles, same slit; but whether T and m affect the velocity.

Alternatively, in this scenario, say we have:

Case 1: m1, T1. first maxima (n=1) at 15 degrees: a sin(theta1) = n lambda1 → lambda1= a sin(theta1)/1.

Case 2: m2=2m1, T2. Second maxima (n=2) at theta2=20 degrees: a sin(theta2)=n lambda2 → lambda2= a sin(theta2)/2.

Then, lambda1= a sin(15) /1; lambda2= a sin(20)/2. Therefore,

lambda1 /lambda2= [a sin(15)/1] / [a sin(20)/2 ]= 2 sin(15)/sin(20)

Calculate that:

sin(15)≈0.2588; sin(20)=0.3420

Thus,

lambda1/lambda2= 2 *0.2588/0.3420≈0.5176/0.3420≈1.513.

From de Broglie wavelength relation:

We had earlier:

lambda= h/(mv), but for thermal speeds.

Also, velocities filtered to be average from MB distribution.

Earlier analysis gets:

lambda1 = h/( sqrt(8/pi k_B T1 m1))

lambda2= h/( sqrt(8/pi k_B T2 *2 m1)) [since m2=2m1]

Therefore, (lambda1/lambda2)= sqrt( (T2 *2 m1) / (T1 m1) ) )=sqrt(2 T2 / T1 )

Thus,

lambda1/lambda2= sqrt(2 T2/T1 )

From that,

sqrt(2 T2/T1 )=1.513

Square both sides:2 T2 / T1= (1.513)^2≈ 2.289

Therefore,

T1/T2= 2 /2.289≈0.874.

Ratio T1/T2= ~0.874, which is none of the answer choices.

Wait, so perhaps another error enters here. The way that wavelength corresponds to the velocity: If the filter passes particles with speeds close to the average speed.

Average speed aMB= sqrt(8k_B T/(pi m)).

Therefore, velocity approximation to v=sqrt(8k_B T/(pi m))

de Broglie wavelength is lambda= h/(m v)=h/(m* sqrt(8k_B T/(pi m)) )

which simplifies to:

lambda= h/(sqrt(8k_B T m/pi ))= h/(sqrt(8/π k_B T m)).

Which gives:

lambda= h /sqrt( (8/pi ) k_B T m )

But (8/pi) approx 2.546

Therefore,

lambda= h/(sqrt(2.546 k_B T m )).

Therefore,

lambda proportional to 1/sqrt(T m).

If in experiment 1, lambda1∝1/sqrt(T1 m1), and in experiment 2,lambda2∝1/sqrt(T2 m2)=1/sqrt(2 T2 m1)

since m2=2m1.

Thus:

lambda1 / lambda2= sqrt(2 T2 m1 / (T1 m1) ) = sqrt(2 T2 / T1 )

Which matches previous analysis.

Now, according to the original angles.

If I use wrong minima-based assumption:

lambda1/lambda2=1.513= sqrt(2 T2/T1)→≈2.289=2 T2/T1→ T1/T2≈.874. No.

But our first method was ≈1.18 which contradicts. Possible that there's a missing factor.

Alternatively, perhaps not considering the angle correctly. Or perhaps instead of a single-slit they used something else.

Alternatively, maybe assuming something else. Let's think perhaps particle wavelength passing through slit, resulting in a diffraction angle. The equation for the diffraction angle is sin(theta) = lambda/a, as in the first minima. Perhaps if we assume that the first bright spot is at the first minima? But no. Or that primary maximum?

Alternatively, perhaps if the slit is modeled as a Gaussian aperture, then Fourier transform to a Gaussian spread, but that's different.

Wait, but given that it's standard single-slit diffraction and there might be a miscalculation in my initial steps.

Wait, perhaps the problem's mentioning of particles coming from a thermal source and selecting those with a speed close to average.

When the problem says "filter that selects only those particles that have a speed close to the average (of all the particles from the source)", which speed are they referring to? The average speed? That would be the average from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.

If they are selecting particles with speeds close to the average, then the velocity of the particles in the experiment would be v_avg = sqrt(8 k_B T/(pi m))

Then their de Broglie wavelength lambda= h/(m v)= h/(m sqrt(8 k_B T/(pi m)) )= h/(sqrt(8 m k_B T/pi ))

Therefore, lambda= h/sqrt(8/pi m k_B T )

So lambda is proportional to 1/sqrt(m T)

Therefore, the relation between lambda1 and lambda2 is:

lambda1 / lambda2= sqrt( (m2 T2)/(m1 T1) )

But m2= 2m1, so:

lambda1/lambda2= sqrt( (2 m1 T2 ) / (m1 T1 ) )= sqrt(2 T2 / T1 )

Therefore,

lambda1= lambda2 sqrt(2 T2 / T1 )

Alternatively,

lambda2= lambda1 sqrt( T1 / (2 T2 ) )

Now, considering the setup: the slit width a, the diffraction angle theta relates the wavelength via the equation for a particular order.

From single-slit diffraction, minima at a sin(theta)=n lambda, but they mention bright regions, which happen at approximately (n + 1/2)lambda perhaps? Let’s suppose that the problem uses the approximation that the first bright after the central is at a sin(theta)=1.5lambda, as an approximation (half between n=1 and n=2 minima).

For the first setup ("the first bright one closest to the center" at theta1=15°), assumption would be a sin(theta1)=1.5 lambda1.

For the second setup (second bright region is either n=2, therefore a sin(theta2)=2.5lambda2, as a approximation.

But then, theta2=20°, second bright region— maybe if first is at 1.5 lambda, the second is at 2.5 lambda. But actual secondary maxima aren't exactly at those positions, but if the problem assumes that, then proceed.

Therefore:

Case 1:

a sin(theta1) = 1.5 lambda1 → lambda1= a sin(theta1)/1.5

Case 2:

a sin(theta2) = 2.5 lambda2 → lambda2= a sin(theta2)/2.5

Thus, lambda1 / lambda2= [sin(theta1)/1.5]/ [sin(theta2)/2.5 ]= [sin(15)/1.5]/[sin(20)/2.5 ]= [0.2588/1.5]/[0.3420/2.5 ]= [0.1725]/[0.1368 ]≈ 1.260

But according to the wavelength relation:

lambda1/lambda2= sqrt(2 T2 /T1 )≈1.260 → squaring gives 2 T2/T1≈1.587 → T1/T2≈2/1.587≈1.259.

Approx 1.26, which is also not one of the options. ( options are 1.3 close). But since earlier approximation gives 1.26 using incorrect n+1/2. But perhaps the approximate model.

But in given answer choices, 1.3 (B). However, given that precision of the application:

If using a sin(theta)= (n +1/2)lambda for the first and second maxima.

Though, this could be a different model.

However, other possibility: diffraction patterns can also be modeled using the approximation that theta ≈ lambda / a (if sin(theta)~theta).

But theta=15 degrees and 20 degrees are not very small angles (15 gradi is 0.262 rad), But perhaps the problem is still in radian approximation? Not accurate, but let's try.

If I use the small-angle approximation theta≈lambda/a, but using angle in radians.

First case: theta1=15degree≈0.2618 rad= lambda1/a →lambda1= a theta1.

Second case: theta2=20degree≈0.349 rad= 2*lambda2/a (second bright region, so perhaps n=2 implies theta=2 lambda/a ). Then lambda2= a theta2 /2.

Thus,

lambda1/lambda2= (a theta1)/ (a theta2 /2 )= 2 theta1/theta2= 2*(15°)/20°= 30/20=1.5. Then,

lambda1/lambda2=1.5= sqrt( 2 T2 / T1 )

then squared is1.5^2=2.25=2 T2/T1 → T1/T2=2/2.25= 0.888..., which isn't in the options.

Hmm, This is getting frustrating because regardless of the approach, I keep getting answers not among the choices, leading me to think that maybe there's an error in approach.

Wait, let's recall that perhaps after the filter, which selects only particles with speed close to the average, their velocity becomes the average speed. So the relevant velocity isv_avg = sqrt(8 k_B T/(pi m)).

Thus, de Broglie wavelength lambda = h/(m v) = h/(m sqrt(8 k_B T/(pi m))) = h/(sqrt(8 k_B T m / pi)).

Thus,

lambda = h / sqrt( (8/pi)k_B T m )

Thus, lambda is inverse proportional to sqrt(T m). Thus,

lambda1/lambda2= sqrt( (T2 m2 ) / (T1 m1 ) )

But m2=2m1→ lambda1/lambda2= sqrt( 2 T2 / T1 )

This part is correct.

For the diffraction:

Assuming the problem uses the single-slit minima formula a sinθ = nλ. But since they mention bright regions as observed... If they incorrectly use the formula with bright regions for a sinθ =nλ, that explanation.

If that's the case, which is actually erroneous physically, the bright regions would be misinterpreted as a sinθ =nλ.

But the problem gives for the first experiment:

First bright closest to center: n=0. Hmm, central maximum. First bright then would be n=0. The problem contradicts. Maybe If instead they call dark regions first minima as first dark, so then their first bright region ( closest to center) is in between n=0 and n=1, but this still requires some approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers constructive interference as per some formula. But because the physics here seems inconsistent, or possibly ambiguous, it leaves me pondering.

Considering that the available answer is 1.3, and earlier when i used the position of Secondary maxima using the coeffs 1.43, the result came to ~1.18; very precise approximate options not listed.

But the closes possible answer given in Option B) 1.3. But perhaps in their calculation, instead of a sin(theta)=1.43 lambda, perhaps use something else.

Alternatively, in the second experiment, the particle mass is double, leading to different velocity.

Let me maybe re-express the final formula.

From:

lambda1 / lambda2 = sqrt(2 T2 / T1 )

But lambda1 comes from the first bright at theta1=15°, as a sin(theta1)=1.43 lambda1

lambda2 comes from the second bright at theta2=20°, a sin(theta2)=2.45 lambda2

Therefore,

(a sin15 /1.43 ) / (a sin20 /2.45) )= sqrt(2 T2 /T1 )

Cancel a:

( sin15 /1.43 ) / ( sin20 /2.45 ) = sqrt(2 T2 / T1 )

Compute sin15=0.2588, sin20=0.3420

(0.2588 /1.43 ) / (0.3420 /2.45 )= (0.2588 /1.43) * (2.45 /0.3420 )

=0.2588 /1.43≈0.1807; 2.45 /0.3420≈7.163

Multiply together:0.1807*7.163≈1.295

Hence,

1.295≈sqrt(2 T2 / T1 )

Squared:1.677→tương đương 2 T2/T1=1.677→T1/T2=2/1.677≈1.191.

Gần như trước.

Therefore, approximates to 1.19. Answer is t≈1.3 được lựa chọn. Tuy nhiên no answer given options include it.

Hmm. Thus, perhaps the difference is use of root mean square speed instead of average speed. Because maybe the problem uses rms speed instead of mean speed for the filter. Let me verify what if we used vrms.

The root mean square speed is sqrt(3k_B*T/m ). Nếu filter selects v rms then different lambda.

But the problem states the filter selects "particles that have a speed close to the average (of all the particles from the source)" — average, like mean speed.

But assuming, the problem might erroneously consider "average speed" to be the root mean square speed. Maybe it's a wording issue.

Hmm. If so,

v_rms= sqrt(3k_BT/m)

Thus, Lambda= h/(m v_rms)= h/( m * sqrt(3k_B T/m ))= h/( sqrt(3 m k_B T ) )

Thus,

lambda is proportional to 1/sqrt( m T )

Thus, lambda1/lambda2= sqrt( m2 T2 / m1 T1 )

But m2=2m1, so sqrt( 2 m1 T2 / m1 T1 )=sqrt( 2 T2/T1 ), same as before.

Thus, same result. Not helpful.

Alternatively, if the problem took velocities as most probable speed.

The most probable speed v_p= sqrt(2k_BT/m).

Then,

lambda= h/(m v_p)= h/( sqrt(2k_B m T ) )

Thus,

lambda proportional to 1/sqrt(mT )

Same as previous relationship, thus lambda1/lambda2= sqrt(2 T2 / T1 ), same result.

Vì vậy, không có thay đổi.

Alternatively, maybe sử dụng khác wavelength formula. Có thể lỗi something another.

Wait, perhaps the problem implicitly assumes that the filter selects particles with v_average such that KE is proportional to T. V maybe average kinetic energy.

Wait, trường hợp không phải đây là Maxwell-Boltzmann which gives average KE as 3/2 k_B T.

Nhưng lỗi khi particles are filtered có tốc độ gần với average speed (tốc độ trung bình ), but nếu họ giả định KE là (1/2 mv^2 ) = c*T , then v= sqrt(2cT/m).

Nhưng nếu cách giả định khác nhau có thế kéo theo hệ quả khác.

Alternatively, Giả sử trường hợp problem dùng different tính toán average.

But theo như đề bài (nonrelativistic, Maxwell-Boltzmann ), average speed is v= sqrt(8k_BT/(pi m ) ).

Alternative, possible the average speed is being considered as sqrt(2k_BT/m ), but đó là tốc độ most probable. So nếu nhầm lẫn dùng most probable tốc độ.

Nếu problem thought that average speed is v=sqrt( 2k_B T/m ), thì:

lambda1 = h/( m1 * sqrt( 2k_B T1/m1 ) ) = h / sqrt( 2k_B T1 m1 )

Similarly, lambda2 = h / (2m1 * sqrt(2k_B T2/(2m1) )) ) = h / (2m1 sqrt( k_B T2/m1 )) )

= h / (2 sqrt( k_B T2 m1 )) )

Tỉ số lambda1 / lambda2= [ h/sqrt(2k_B T1 m1 ) ] / [ h/(2 sqrt(k_B T2 m1) ) ]= 2 sqrt(k_B T2 m1 ) / sqrt(2k_B T1 m1 )

= 2 / sqrt(2) sqrt( T2 /T1 ) = sqrt(2) sqrt( T2 / T1 )

Therefore,

lambda1/lambda2= sqrt( 2 T2 /T1 )

 same as previous case, dẫn đến T1/T2≈1.19 . Vẫn không giống answer choices.

Maybe given that the discrepancy exists, and none of the answer options match with my calculations, I might have made a mistake in calculation steps.

Wait, mình check lại các bước.

Given a=2.5 micrometers, which is a width 2.5 micrometers, but nó cancel in the ratio.

When theta1=15°, first bright (primary maximum) nơi approximately1.43lambda/a.

Theta2=20°, second maximum around 2.45lambda/a. Equations:

a sintheta1=1.43 lambda1.

a sinh theta2=2.45 lambda2.

Nên lamba1= a sintheta1 /1.43. Lambda2= a sinh theta2 /2.45.

 lambda1 là [ (a*sin15)/1.43 ] ;lambda2 là [a*sin20)/2.45 ]

Ratio lambd1/lambda2= [sin15/1.43] / [ sin20/2.45 ] = (2.45/1.43)*(sin15/sin20) ≈ 1.719 *0.7567≈1.30。

 Tương ứng với sqrt(2 T2 / T1 )=1.30。 → square: 1.69= 2 T2 / T1 → T1/T2= 2 /1.69→≈1.183.

Again, 1.18, which's NOT matching any đáp án.

But the options have 1.3 or 1.9. If the problem mistook the diffraction equation for the nth bright fringes at a sinh(theta)=n lambda.

Nếu có ai làm như thế:

Case 1: 1st bright = a sintheta= lambda → lambda1= a sin15.

Case2: 2nd bright= a sinh theta= 2 lambda2 → lambda2= a sin20/2.

Do đó, lambda1/lambda2= [ a sin15 ] / [ a sin20 /2 ]= 2 sin15 / sin20.

 sin15/sin20≈0.2588/0.3420≈0.7567. 2*0.7567≈1.5134.

 lambda1/lambda2≈1.5134 = sqrt(2T2/T1 ) → v square=> T1/T2≈ 2/(1.5134)^2≈2/2.29≈0.873。Tương ứng với T1/T2≈0.87. Nhưng lức này rất xa các options. None.

Alternatively, nếu problem đang thực sự dùng formula dấu bằng cho thứ cấp maxima Approximate positions sử phụ thuộc vào intensity nhưng không được biết chính xác. Wait, when using approximate positions for secondary maxima:

The first secondary maximum là lúc diffraction pattern đạt maxima. Vị trí của các maxima được cho bởi các nghiệm của đạo hàm của hàm cường độ equal zero. intensity là [sin(beta/2)/(beta/2)]^2 với beta=(pi a sinh theta)/lambda.

 derivative of intensity sets to zero.

 result is transcendental equation, alpha= tan alpha, where alpha=beta/2= (pi a sinh theta)/(2 lambda).

 Đối với first secondary maxima, solution is alpha≈1.4303.

 Như vậy, (pi a sinh theta)/(2 lambda)=1.4303 → a sinh theta=(2*1.4303 /pi) lambda≈ (2.8606/3.1416)*lambda≈0.910 lambda. Wait Như vậy dùng formula này cho a sinh theta≈0.910 lambda.

Nếu vậy:

 First secondary maxima (lose this).

 Nhưng đây mâu thuẫn với giá trị trên hyperphysics.

Chờ, Hyperphysics states:

http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/phyopt/sinint.html#c3

Central maximum (m=0) at beta=0, then minima m=±1,±2,...

Secondary maxima xnằm ở đâu?

The first secondary maxima occurs approx at beta=1.430π, allowing approximate equation:

 beta/pi= m≈1.43.

 Where beta= (pi a sinh theta)/lambda=1.43pi. → a sinh theta=1.43 lambda.

 tương tự như ban đầu.

Therefore, positions vẫn như đã tính.

Tương tự với approximate approach.

Với giới hạn thời gian, cho đến thời điểm hiện tại sử dụng calculation của tôi cho T1/T2≈1.18, mấu chốt các answer options không có.

Nhưng đáp án (B) 1.3 gần nhất, only other choice is (D)1.9, tôi có tính toán sai.

Wait một phút. Khi tính từ công thức:

 lambda1/lambda2=1.3 → sqrt( 2T2 / T1 )=1.3 → T2 / T1=1.69 /2≈0.845 → T1/T2≈1.183. Rounded đên 1.2, But option B says 1.3. If we use precise calculation steps, như delta between sine values. Let's maybe use more precise computations?

Let 2.459/1.4303 exactly:

2.459 / 1.4303.

Use a calculator:

Tại thời điệmtinh: 243.

 compute:

1.4303 * 1.718= 1.43 * 1.718~ (1.43*1.7=2.431, plus 1.43*0.018=0.02574)→ tổng 2.456, gần với 2.459 → Vậy 2.459/1.4303≈1.718.

Khi đó, ( sin15 /sin20 ):

 sin15≈0.2588190, sin20≈0.3420201. Tỉ số 0.2588190/0.3420201=0.7568025.

 So 1.718*0.7568=Compute step-by-step:

1.718*0.7000=1.2026

1.718*0.0500=0.0859

1.718*0.0068=0.01168

Tong.: 1.2026 +0.0859=1.2885 +0.01168=1.299.8.

 close đến ~1.30, lambda ratio≈1.30.

 Sau đó sqrt( 2 T2 /T1)=1.30. Bình phương:2 T2/ T1=1.69→T1/T2=2.0/1.69≈1.1831. Which is not an answer option.

But lưu ý, answer options là các lụa chọn chữ số signif như (A)2.2, (B)1.3,., chứng tỏ người ta có thể làm tròn số, nhưng không chắc chắn.

Thật sự thì ta thấy calculation chính xác, ≈1.18, nhưng trùng khớp không có, như vậy có thể đề bài đang nhầm lẫn giữa angular position của secondary maxima và minima.

Suppose problem confuse vị trí của bright và đark fringes:

Assuming that "bright regions are observed, with the first bright one (closest to the center) located at an angle of 15 degrees." But maybe this is actually the first minima (dark fringe) and the problem says it's first bright region due to some confusion.

First case: a sin(theta1)=lambda (first dark fringe, supposed to be dark), but problem erroneously labels it as bright.

Second case: sin(theta2)=2lambda.→ first dark and second dark.

Thus, solving this incorrectly:

Assuming bright regions are at a sin(theta)=n lamda. Thực tế, trường hợp minima, dark fringes.

But the problem says bright regions occur ay these angles. Đó là sự nhầm lẫn.

If this is trường hợp, chúng ta cần làm bài toán như sau:

First case:

bright region tại theta1=15°: a sintheta1=1*lambda1 → lambda1= a sin theta1.

Second case:

 second bright at theta2=20°: a sin theta2=2 lambda2 →lambda2= a sin theta2 /2.

Tỉ số:

 lambda1/lambda2= [a sin theta1]/ [ a sin theta2/2)]= 2 sin(theta1)/sin(theta2)= 2* sin(15)/sin(20)≈2*(0.2588)/0.3420≈ 1.513.

 theo  relationships,

 lambda1/lambda2= sqrt( 2T2 /T1 )

1.513= sqrt(2*T2/T1)→ squared,2.289≈2*T2/T1 → T1/T2=approx 0.874.

 still chọn NaN.

 Alternatively, nhầm lẫn vai trò.

If mistakenly use lambda = a sin(theta) vả they take the first bright as the central peak, then các phương trình sai hoàn toàn.

Nhưng không rõ. Cảnh quan các lựa chọn answer, option B is 1.3 và D là1.9. 

Alternatively, maybe tôi có sai ở chỗ m2=2*m1.

Remember that m2=2*m1, so when calculating vận tốc trung bình:

Vận tốc trung bình (average) là:

v_avg = sqrt( 8k_B T/( pi m) ), nên particles after the filter for the first case:

v1= sqrt(8k, T1/(pi m1))

For second case:

v2= sqrt(8k, T2/(pi * m2))=sqrt(8k, T2/(pi*2m))

Tương tự.

De Broglie wavelength given by lambda= h/(m*v). Do đó:

lambda1= h / (m1 *v1 ) = h / ( m1 * sqrt(8k T1/(pi m1 )))=h/ (sqrt(8k T1 m1, pi) )

Similarly, lambda2= h/(m2*v2)= h/( 2m1 *sqrt( 8k T2/(pi 2 m1 ))) )=h/(sqrt( 16k T2 m1 / pi) )= h/(4 sqrt(k T2 m1 /pi ) )

Ratio lambda1/lambda2= [ h / sqrt(8k T1 m1 /pi ) ] /[ h/(4 sqrt(k T2 m1 /pi )) ]=4 sqrt(k T2m1 /pi ) / sqrt(8k T1 m1 / pi )

=4 sqrt( T2/(8 T1 ) )=4/ (2*sqrt(2) )) * sqrt( T2 / T1 )=2/sqrt(2) *sqrt( T2 / T1 )= sqrt(2)*sqrt( T2 /T1 )

Therefore, lambda1/lambda2= sqrt( 2 T2 /T1 )

Which is the same as before....

Hmm. FML, after repeatedly through steps, can’t reach one of the answer options So có lẽ in author's solution process áp dụng một gần đúng different.

Assume that a*sin(theta)=n*lambda n where n=1 for the first bright region and n=2 for the second, directly, regardless of diffraction pattern chính xác.

Then:

For first experiment: a sin(theta1)=n1 lambda1 λ

 first bright at 15° → n1=1: lambda1= a sintheta1=2.5e-6 m * sin(15degrees)≈2.5e-6 *0.2588≈6.47e-7 m.

 For second experiment: theta2=20°, n=2: a sin(theta2)=n2 lambda2 → lambda2=(2.5e-6 m* sin20)/2≈(2.5e-6 *0.3420)/2≈4.275e-7 m.

 tính lambda1 và lambda2:

 ratio lambda1/lambda2=6.47e-7 /4.275e-7≈1.513.

 Lại ratio này, used to compute T1/T2.

 vì lambda tỷ lệ de Broglie wave, vận tốc aMB, as before, ra ~.874, still mâu thuẫn.

Alternatively, T1/T2= (lambda2 / lambda1 )^2* 2 theo earlier:

Vì, lambda1/lambda2= sqrt(2* T2 /T1 ) → T1/T2= (lambda1/lambda2 )^2 * 2/( T2/T1 )

 wait, có nhầm lẫn. Rewrite:

 lambda1/lambda2= sqrt(2 T2/T1 )

 → (lambda1/lambda2)^2=2 T2/T1.

 Therefore, T1/T2= 2 T2/(lambda1/lambda2)^2= [2 ] / (lambda1/lambda2)^2.

Wait no! Wait:

Wait solve for T1/T2.

 Square Both sides:

 (lambda1/lambda2)^2= 2*T2/T1

 => T1/T2= 2*T2/( (lambda1/lambda2)^2 * T1 )

 No, that doesn't.

 Wait, giải correctly:

 we have:

 (lambda1 / lambda2 )^2 = 2 T2 / T1

 Therefore, T1 / T2 = 2 T / (lambda1 / lambda2 )^2

 Wait, no.

 Wait from:

( lambda1/lambda2 )^2 = 2 T2 /T1

 Multiply both sides by T1:

 (lambda1/lambda2 )^2 T1 = 2 T2

 Then:

T1 / T2 = 2/( (lambda1/lambda2 )^2 )

 Oh, yes.

 Vậy nếu lambda1/lambda2=1.513 → T1/T2=2/(1.513)^2≈ 2/2.289≈≈0.874.

 So answers 0.874, none.

 Given the answer options are T1/T2 thì tỷ  lực đòn bẩy, but it's still doesn't resolve. Hence, có thế lại phải kết luận đề thiếu thông tin hoặc lỗi. Song sinh viên phải chon mot trong cai co san.

 trong options, đáp s phải là (B)1.3 hoặc (D)1.9. Tuy nhiên my nearest calculation là≈1.18 tức không có 옵션이.

Tuy nhiên,

**Final Answer**
The answer is closest to option (B) 1.3. Given possible rounding or approximations in the problem, I will select \(\boxed{B}\).
