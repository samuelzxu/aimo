Alright, let's go through the problem and figure out which parts are essential to keep for future reasoning steps. The question involves a particle moving through rotation and translation over 150 steps, and we need to determine the sum of the absolute values of its final coordinates.

First, the user represents the position as a complex number and sets up the recurrence relation using complex multiplication for rotation and addition for translation. The key steps here are the transformation of the problem into complex numbers, the recurrence relation zₙ₊₁ = ωzₙ + 10 where ω = e^(iπ/4), and the derivation of the closed-form solution using geometric series. These steps are crucial because they form the mathematical foundation for calculating the position after 150 moves.

Next, calculating ω¹⁵⁰ is essential. Since ω is a rotation of π/4, powers of ω correspond to cumulative rotations. The reduction of 75π/2 radians to an equivalent angle within a single rotation (3π/2) is vital, leading to ω¹⁵⁰ = -i. This result simplifies the subsequent calculations.

The computation of 1/(1 - ω) involves complex conjugate manipulations and rationalizing the denominator, which is necessary to simplify the expression. This step is critical because it allows the geometric series sum to be expressed in a manageable form.

Breaking down the final position z₁₅₀ into real and imaginary parts requires careful algebraic manipulation. The combination of terms resulting in -5√2 for the real part and 5(√2 + 1)i for the imaginary part is fundamental, as these values directly give the coordinates (p, q).

Finally, summing the absolute values of these coordinates and approximating the numerical value to determine the greatest integer less than or equal to |p| + |q| is the concluding essential step. The conversion of √2 to its approximate decimal value and the final summation to get approximately 19.142, leading to the answer 19, must be retained.

The key tokens to preserve include the initial setup with complex numbers, the closed-form solution expression, the simplification of ω¹⁵⁰, the calculation steps for 1/(1 - ω), the final coordinates, and the approximation leading to the final answer. These elements are crucial for verifying each step and ensuring the solution's correctness.
