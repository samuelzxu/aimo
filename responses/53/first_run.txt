Okay, let's start by understanding the problem. We have triangle ABC with medians AD and CE intersecting at point P, which is the centroid. We're given PE = 1.5, PD = 2, and DE = 2.5. We need to find the area of quadrilateral AEDC.

First, since D and E are midpoints of BC and AB respectively, DE is the midline of the triangle, so DE = 1/2 AC. Given DE = 2.5, AC must be 5. The centroid divides each median into a 2:1 ratio. So, if PE = 1.5, the entire median CE is 4.5. Similarly, PD = 2 means the median AD is 6. Using coordinates, we set E at the origin (0,0) and A, B, C with appropriate coordinates. Calculating coordinates for D as the midpoint of BC and using the centroid properties, we solve equations based on given distances. Finally, using the shoelace formula with coordinates of A, E, D, and C gives the area of AEDC as 27/2.
