Okay, let's break down where the essential tokens are in the reasoning process. The key steps involve calculating the cell constant, converting conductance to conductivity, finding molar conductivity, determining the degree of dissociation from pH, and relating molar conductivity to limiting molar conductivity.

1. **Cell Constant Calculation**: The cell constant is l/A = 120 cm / 1 cm². This is crucial because it's used to find conductivity.
   
2. **Conductivity (κ) Calculation**: κ = G × cell constant = 5e-7 S × 120 cm⁻¹. This step converts measured conductance into conductivity, which is necessary for molar conductivity.
   
3. **Molar Conductivity (Λm)**: Λm = κ / c. The concentration conversion to mol/cm³ and the division are vital for getting Λm.
   
4. **Degree of Dissociation (α) from pH**: α = [H⁺]/c = 1e-4 / 0.0015. The pH gives [H⁺], which determines how much the acid dissociates.
   
5. **Limiting Molar Conductivity (Λm°)**: Λm° = Λm / α = 40 / (1/15) = 600 S cm²/mol. This is the final calculation linking all previous steps.

Each of these steps contains essential numbers and formulas needed to arrive at Z=6. Specific values like 120 cm, 5e-7 S, 1e-4 pH, and 0.0015 M must be retained as they directly impact each calculation.
