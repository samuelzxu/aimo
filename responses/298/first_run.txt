Okay, I need to figure out which tokens to keep for the reasoning steps. Let me go through each paragraph and see which parts are essential for future steps.

Starting with the problem description: The first paragraph explains the calculator's buttons and their operations. Since the user already knows the problem, maybe this can be condensed. But some key info like D# is 2x+1 and Db is 2x-1 is important.

In the thinking trajectory, the initial reasoning about forward and reverse operations is crucial. The key insight here is working backward from 313 by reversing the operations, determining predecessors. The steps where they try reversing from 313 and find that 156 is invalid, then 157, 79, 39, 19, 9, etc., are essential. These specific numerical steps must be kept because they show the path to the solution.

The part where they consider the equation for N=256 + sum of terms based on button presses is critical because it mathematically models all possible numbers. The explanation about the sum being odd and thus all results must be odd is key for part ii. The conclusion that all odd integers from 1 to 511 are possible relies on this reasoning, so those parts must be marked.

Each time they test a predecessor and check if it's an integer is important. For example, checking if 156 leads to non-integers, thus invalid. These validations are necessary steps in the logic.

The final answer's derivation, especially the sequence derived from the equation and verifying it step-by-step, is vital. The verification showing each press leading to the next number until 313 confirms the sequence is correct.

Also, the discussion about parity and how each operation preserves oddness is fundamental for part ii. This establishes why only odd numbers are possible, which is a core part of the proof.

I need to ensure all these critical points are marked with <keep> tags. Specifically, the step-by-step backward reasoning, the mathematical model for possible numbers, the parity argument, and the verification steps are essential. The initial problem understanding and forward steps can be summarized, but the key transitions in reasoning must be preserved.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 1: <keep>Since it's asking for a sequence of eight presses, maybe we can model this as a binary tree where each node branches into two possibilities: D# or Db.</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 2: <keep>However, 2^8 = 256 possible sequences, which is manageable for a computer but too tedious manually.</keep>
- Paragraph 3, Sentence 1: <keep>Alternatively, maybe we can work backwards.</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 1: <keep>313 can be obtained either by:</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 2: <keep>Reversing D#: (313 - 1)/2 = 312/2 = 156</keep>
- Paragraph 4, Sentence 3: <keep>Reversing Db: (313 + 1)/2 = 314/2 = 157</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 1: <keep>156. Can 156 be obtained via reverse operations?</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 2: <keep>Reverse D#: (156 -1)/2 = 155/2 = 77.5 Not integer.</keep>
- Paragraph 5, Sentence 3: <keep>Reverse Db: (156 +1)/2 = 157/2 = 78.5 Not integer.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 1: <keep>Therefore, 156 is invalid.</keep>
- Paragraph 6, Sentence 2: <keep>Therefore, the only possible valid predecessor of 313 is 157.</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 1: <keep>157 can come from reverse D#: (157 - 1)/2 = 156/2 = 78</keep>
- Paragraph 7, Sentence 2: <keep>Reverse Db: (157 + 1)/2 = 158/2 = 79</keep>
- Paragraph 8, Sentence 1: <keep>78 can’t be reversed (needs previous to be non-integers), therefore last press must have been Db, resulting in 157.</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 1: <keep>79:</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 2: <keep>Reverse D#: (79 -1)/2 = 78/2 = 39</keep>
- Paragraph 9, Sentence 3: <keep>Reverse Db: (79 + 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40</keep>
- Paragraph 10, Sentence 1: <keep>39 can come from 19 or 20.</keep>
- Paragraph 11, Sentence 1: <keep>40 can't be obtained from previous operations, so Step 5 must have been 39.</keep>

- Paragraph 12, Sentence 2: <keep>predecessors: via D#: 9; via Db:10.</keep>
- Paragraph 13, Sentence 1: <keep>19 came from D# on step3 number 9.</keep>
- Paragraph 14, Sentence 1: <keep>Step3:9 predecessors: via D# (4) or via Db (5).</keep>

- Paragraph 15, Sentence 3: <keep>If first D#, then second press: 2*3 +1=7 or 2*3 -1=5.</keep>
- Paragraph 16, Sentence 1: <keep>Thus after two presses, possible numbers are1,3,5,7.</keep>
- Paragraph 17, Sentence 1: <keep>Thus, number4 cannot be obtained in two presses.</keep>
- Paragraph 18, Sentence 1: <keep>Working backwards might lead us through paths that are impossible in forward steps.</keep>
- Paragraph 19, Sentence 1: <keep>Maximum possible number after 8 D# presses: ... a8=511</keep>
