Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine the probability that a randomly chosen number from set S (integers between 1 and 2^40 with exactly two 1's in binary) is divisible by 9, and then find p + q where the probability is p/q in simplest form.

First, understand the structure of set S. Numbers with exactly two 1's in binary are of the form 2^k + 2^m where 0 ≤ m < k ≤ 39. The total number of such numbers is combination C(40, 2) = 780. This is the denominator of the probability.

Next, we need the numerator: the count of numbers in S divisible by 9. For a number 2^k + 2^m to be divisible by 9, we factor out 2^m, leading to 2^m(1 + 2^(k-m)) ≡ 0 mod 9. Since 2 and 9 are coprime, this reduces to 1 + 2^d ≡ 0 mod 9, where d = k - m. Solving 2^d ≡ 8 mod 9, we find the period of 2 modulo 9 is 6, so d ≡ 3 mod 6.

Valid d values (differences between exponents) are 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, 33, 39. For each d, the number of valid (m, k) pairs is 40 - d. Summing these gives the total valid numbers: 37 + 31 + 25 + 19 + 13 + 7 + 1 = 133.

Check that 133 and 780 are coprime. Since 133 factors into 7×19 and 780 into 2²×3×5×13, they share no common factors. Thus, the probability is 133/780, and p + q = 133 + 780 = 913.
