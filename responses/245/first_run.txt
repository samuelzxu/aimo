Okay, I need to figure out which statements about the galvanometers are true based on their configurations. Let's break it down step by step.

**Voltage Range Analysis:**

- To maximize the voltage range for a galvanometer, we need to add as much series resistance as possible. The formula for maximum voltage is \( V_{\text{max}} = I_g (R_C + R_{\text{series}}) \).
  
- **Statement (A):** All components in series. This gives total resistance \( 2R_C + 2R \). However, the voltage across each galvanometer is \( I_g R_C \), which isn't maximized. This configuration doesn't use resistors optimally for one galvanometer. Hence, **incorrect**.
  
- **Statement (B):** Two resistors and one galvanometer in series, with the second galvanometer in parallel. This configuration results in a higher total resistance \( R_C + 2R \) for the first galvanometer, while the parallel galvanometer allows higher current through resistors. Calculations show \( V_{\text{max}} = I_g (4R + R_C) \), which is higher than in (A). Hence, **correct**.

**Current Range Analysis:**

- To maximize the current range, we need minimal shunt resistance. The formula for maximum current is \( I_{\text{max}} = I_g (1 + \frac{R_C}{R_{\text{shunt}}}) \).
  
- **Statement (C):** All components in parallel. This gives the lowest shunt resistance \( R_{\text{shunt}} = \frac{1}{2/R_C + 2/R} \), maximizing \( I_{\text{max}} \). Hence, **correct**.
  
- **Statement (D):** Two galvanometers in series and resistors in parallel. This configuration results in higher shunt resistance compared to (C), leading to a lower \( I_{\text{max}} \). Hence, **incorrect**.

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{BC}
