Okay, let's break down how I approached this problem. The goal was to show that for any integer n ≥ 2, there exist invertible 2x2 real matrices with non-zero entries such that the sum of their inverses equals the inverse of their sum. 

First, I considered the case for n=2. This involved setting up an equation where the sum of inverses of two matrices equals the inverse of their sum. By manipulating the equation, I found that the matrices must satisfy a specific matrix equation (C² + C + I = 0). Using a companion matrix for the polynomial λ² + λ + 1 = 0 worked, and I verified this with a concrete example.

Next, for higher n, I realized that adding pairs of matrices (C, -C) would not affect the total sum or the sum of inverses. These pairs cancel out in both the sum and the inverse sum. By starting with the n=2 solution and adding such pairs, the condition holds for any n ≥ 2. Each additional pair maintains the required equation because their contributions cancel out. 

Key tokens to retain include the specific matrices found for n=2, the role of matrix pairs (C, -C), and how their cancellation ensures the equation holds. The construction method and verification steps are critical for the proof, so those parts need to be preserved to understand the extension to any n.
