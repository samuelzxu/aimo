Okay, so I need to figure out if every group of order 1645 is abelian and cyclic. The order given is 5*7*47, which are all primes. Let me recall that for a group whose order is the product of distinct primes, if those primes are all distinct, then the group is cyclic if and only if it is abelian. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me think again.

First, the structure theorem for finite abelian groups tells us that any finite abelian group is a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order. So if a group of order 1645 is abelian, it must be a direct product of cyclic groups whose orders multiply to 1645. Since 1645 factors into 5*7*47, which are distinct primes, the only possible abelian group would be the direct product of cyclic groups of order 5, 7, and 47. Since 5, 7, and 47 are primes, each of those cyclic groups is of prime order, so their direct product would indeed be cyclic (because the orders are pairwise coprime). Therefore, every abelian group of order 1645 is cyclic.

But the question is whether every group of that order is abelian (and hence cyclic). So we need to check if all groups of order 1645 are abelian. For that, we can use the classification of finite simple groups or Sylow theorems. Let me try Sylow theorems first.

The Sylow theorems tell us about the number of Sylow p-subgroups. Let's consider the Sylow p-subgroups for each prime divisor. Let's denote the group as G with |G| = 5*7*47.

First, let's check the number of Sylow 5-subgroups. By Sylow's third theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, denoted n_5, must divide 7*47 = 329 and satisfy n_5 ≡ 1 mod 5. Similarly, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups, n_7, must divide 5*47 = 235 and satisfy n_7 ≡ 1 mod 7. The number of Sylow 47-subgroups, n_47, must divide 5*7 = 35 and satisfy n_47 ≡ 1 mod 47.

Let me compute each case:

For n_5: divides 329 and ≡1 mod5.

329 factors into 7*47. The divisors are 1,7,47,329. Now check which divisors ≡1 mod5.

1 mod5 =1, which is okay.

7 mod5=2, 47 mod5=47-9*5=47-45=2, so 47≡2 mod5. Hence, 7 and 47 are both 2 mod5. 329 mod5: 329 divided by 5 is 65*5 + 4, so 329≡4 mod5. So possible n_5 could be 1 or 329 only. Wait, n_5 must divide 329, so n_5 can be 1,7,47,329. But we have to check which of these are ≡1 mod5. As above, 1≡1 mod5, 7≡2, 47≡2, 329≡4. So only n_5=1 is possible. Therefore, there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, which is normal.

Similarly, check for n_7: must divide 5*47=235, which factors into 5*47. Divisors are 1,5,47,235. Check which are ≡1 mod7.

1 mod7=1, which is acceptable.

5 mod7=5, which is not 1 mod7. 47 mod7: 47-6*7=47-42=5 mod7, so 47≡5 mod7. 235 mod7: 235 is 5*47, which we saw is 5*5=25 mod7=4. Thus, n_7 must be 1. Therefore, exactly one Sylow 7-subgroup, which is normal.

Similarly, check n_47: divides 5*7=35, so divisors are 1,5,7,35. We must have n_47≡1 mod47. Let's check which divisors of 35 satisfy that.

1≡1 mod47: yes.

5 mod47=5, which isn't 1.

7 mod47=7, not 1.

35 mod47=35, not 1. So only possible n_47=1.

Therefore, all Sylow subgroups are normal. Since all Sylow subgroups are normal, G is the direct product of its Sylow subgroups. Since each Sylow subgroup is of prime order, which is cyclic, so G is isomorphic to Z_5 × Z_7 × Z_47, which is cyclic because 5,7,47 are primes and pairwise coprime. Therefore, G is cyclic. Therefore, there is only one group of order 1645 up to isomorphism, which is the cyclic group. Hence, every group of order 1645 is abelian and cyclic.

So the answer should be True.

But wait, hold on. Let me make sure there's no mistake here. Is the fact that all Sylow subgroups are normal sufficient for the group to be the direct product of them?

Yes. If all Sylow subgroups are normal, then the group is the internal direct product of its Sylow subgroups, hence isomorphic to the external direct product. Since each Sylow p-subgroup here is cyclic of prime order, their direct product is cyclic.

Alternatively, using the fact that a group is nilpotent if and only if it's the direct product of its Sylow subgroups. Since all Sylow subgroups here are normal, the group is nilpotent, and therefore is the direct product of its Sylows, hence cyclic.

Alternatively, given that the group has a unique Sylow p-subgroup for each prime p dividing the order, then the group is the direct product of these Sylow subgroups. Since all of them are cyclic and their orders are pairwise coprime, the group is cyclic.

Yes, so indeed, that's correct.

Another way to see: the order is square-free (5,7,47 are distinct primes). A group of square-free order is cyclic if and only if it is abelian? Wait, let's recall that theorem. For square-free order, if the group is abelian, it must be cyclic. Conversely, if a group of square-free order is cyclic, it's abelian. But does non-abelian groups of square-free order exist?

Yes, for example, S_3 has order 6, which is square-free, and is non-abelian. Therefore, for square-free order, the group may be non-abelian. However, in such a case, when can a group of square-free order be non-abelian?

But in our case, we saw that for the specific factors 5,7,47, the Sylow subgroups are all normal. So in such a case, the group can't be non-abelian? Wait, but if all Sylow subgroups are normal, then it's abelian? Wait, the direct product of abelian groups is abelian, yes. Moreover, if each Sylow subgroup is cyclic of prime order, then the direct product is abelian. Therefore, yes, if all Sylow subgroups are normal, and each is abelian (which they are, as cyclic groups of prime order are abelian), then the entire group is abelian. Hence, the group must be abelian.

But in another case, suppose that for some order with square-free, let's say order p*q*r where p < q < r primes. If there exists a non-abelian group, what conditions must be satisfied?

In such a case, if for instance, q divides r-1, or p divides q-1, etc., we can have semidirect products, hence non-abelian groups. But in our case, let's check.

The primes here are 5,7,47. Let's check the divisors:

First, check if 5 divides 7-1=6: 6 divided by 5 is not an integer, so no.

Then check if 5 divides 47-1=46: 46 divided by 5 is 9.2, no.

Check if 7 divides 47-1=46: 46 divided by 7 is approximately 6.57, not an integer.

So none of the primes divide the order of the automorphism groups of the others. Specifically, the automorphism group of Z_p is Z_{p-1} when p is prime. So if, for example, the Sylow q-subgroup's automorphism group has order q-1, then if a prime p divides q-1, we could have a non-trivial semidirect product. But since here, none of the primes divide the others minus one, there are no non-trivial semidirect products.

So for primes 5,7,47:

- The automorphism group of Z_5 has order 4, which is 2^2. Neither 7 nor 47 divide 4.
- The automorphism group of Z_7 has order 6, which is 2*3. 5 and 47 don't divide 6.
- The automorphism group of Z_47 has order 46, which is 2*23. 5 and 7 don't divide 46.

Therefore, there are no non-trivial homomorphisms from any Sylow p-subgroup into the automorphism group of another Sylow q-subgroup, hence no non-trivial semidirect products. Therefore, the only group of order 1645 is the direct product, which is cyclic.

Hence, the conclusion is true: every group of order 1645 is abelian and cyclic.

Thus, the answer is True.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{A}
