Okay, let's break down the problem step by step. We have a rectangle ABCD with AB = 63 and BC = 448. Points E and F are on AD and BC respectively, such that AE = CF = 84. We need to find the distance PQ, where P and Q are the points of tangency of the incircles of triangles BEF and DEF with the side EF.

First, I'll assign coordinates to the rectangle to make calculations easier. Placing point A at (0, 0), the coordinates of the other points are:
- B(63, 0)
- C(63, 448)
- D(0, 448)

Points E and F are then determined based on AE and CF:
- E is 84 units above A on AD, so E(0, 84)
- F is 84 units below C on BC, so F(63, 448 - 84) = F(63, 364)

Next, calculate the lengths of the sides of triangles BEF and DEF to find the semiperimeters, which are crucial for determining the points of tangency. 

For triangle BEF:
- BE is the distance from B(63, 0) to E(0, 84) = √(63² + 84²) = 105
- BF is the vertical distance from B(63, 0) to F(63, 364) = 364
- EF is the distance from E(0, 84) to F(63, 364) = √(63² + 280²) = 287

The semiperimeter of BEF is (105 + 364 + 287)/2 = 378. The distance from E to the tangency point P on EF is semiperimeter minus BF: 378 - 364 = 14. So, EP = 14.

For triangle DEF:
- DE is the vertical distance from D(0, 448) to E(0, 84) = 364
- DF is the distance from D(0, 448) to F(63, 364) = √(63² + 84²) = 105
- EF is the same as before = 287

The semiperimeter of DEF is also (364 + 105 + 287)/2 = 378. The distance from E to the tangency point Q on EF is semiperimeter minus DF: 378 - 105 = 273. So, EQ = 273.

The distance PQ is the absolute difference between EQ and EP: |273 - 14| = 259.

Thus, the final answer is \boxed{259}.

- Paragraph 2, Sentence 3: <keep>Coordinates might help here. Let's assign coordinate system. Let me place point A at (0, 0). Then B would be at (63, 0), C at (63, 448), and D at (0, 448).</keep>
- Paragraph 2, Sentence 4: <keep>Point E is on AD. Since AD is from (0, 0) to (0, 448), AE = 84, so E would be at (0, 84). Similarly, point F is on BC with CF = 84. Since BC is from (63, 448) to (63, 0), CF is 84, so counting 84 units up from C, which is towards B, so F would be at (63, 448 - 84) = (63, 364).</keep>
