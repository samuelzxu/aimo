Okay, let's go through this problem step by step. The goal is to calculate the efficiency of a silicon solar cell given its band gap of 1.11 eV using the Shockley-Queisser limit. 

First, I recall that the Shockley-Queisser limit determines the maximum theoretical efficiency of a solar cell based on its band gap. The efficiency depends on how well the cell can utilize the solar spectrum, considering losses from photons with energy below the band gap (not absorbed) and those above (excess energy lost as heat).

The key factors here are:
1. The band gap of silicon (1.11 eV).
2. The solar spectrum (AM1.5G), which has an integrated power density of 1000 W/m².
3. The calculation of photocurrent, open-circuit voltage, and fill factor.

The process involves:
- Calculating the photocurrent (J_ph) by integrating the number of photons with energy above the band gap.
- Determining the open-circuit voltage (V_oc) using the ratio of photocurrent to reverse saturation current.
- Estimating the fill factor (FF), which is the ratio of maximum power to the product of J_ph and V_oc.
- Combining these to find the maximum power output and then dividing by the incident solar power to get efficiency.

However, the exact integration of the solar spectrum is complex without specific data. Referencing known values and prior research, the Shockley-Queisser limit for silicon's band gap of around 1.1 eV is approximately 33%, even though the peak efficiency for 1.34 eV is 33.7%. Considering the given band gap and slight variations in calculations, 33% is a reasonable approximation.
