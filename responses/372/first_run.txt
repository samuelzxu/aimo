Okay, let's start by understanding the problem. We have a polynomial \( P(x) \) that satisfies two conditions: a functional equation and a specific value equation. Our goal is to find \( P\left(\frac{7}{2}\right) \) and express it as a reduced fraction, then sum the numerator and denominator.

First, let's analyze the functional equation \( (x - 1)P(x + 1) = (x + 2)P(x) \). Plugging in \( x = 1 \) gives \( P(1) = 0 \), and \( x = -2 \) gives \( P(-1) = 0 \). This tells us \( (x - 1)(x + 1) \) are factors of \( P(x) \). So, we can write \( P(x) = (x - 1)(x + 1)Q(x) \).

Substituting this into the original equation simplifies it to \( x Q(x + 1) = (x + 1) Q(x) \). Testing shows \( Q(x) \) must be a multiple of \( x \), so \( Q(x) = kx \). Thus, \( P(x) = kx(x - 1)(x + 1) \).

Next, using the condition \( (P(2))^2 = P(3) \), we find \( k = \frac{2}{3} \). Substituting back, \( P(x) = \frac{2}{3}x(x^2 - 1) \).

Finally, calculate \( P\left(\frac{7}{2}\right) \):
\[
P\left(\frac{7}{2}\right) = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{7}{2} \cdot \left(\left(\frac{7}{2}\right)^2 - 1\right) = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{7}{2} \cdot \frac{45}{4} = \frac{105}{4}
\]
The fraction \( \frac{105}{4} \) is reduced, so \( m + n = 105 + 4 = 109 \).
