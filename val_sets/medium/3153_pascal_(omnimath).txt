Question: Rectangle $W X Y Z$ has $W X=4, W Z=3$, and $Z V=3$. The rectangle is curled without overlapping into a cylinder so that sides $W Z$ and $X Y$ touch each other. In other words, $W$ touches $X$ and $Z$ touches $Y$. The shortest distance from $W$ to $V$ through the inside of the cylinder can be written in the form $\sqrt{\frac{a+b \pi^{2}}{c \pi^{2}}}$ where $a, b$ and $c$ are positive integers. What is the smallest possible value of $a+b+c$?
