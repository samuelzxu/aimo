Question: Three players play tic-tac-toe together. In other words, the three players take turns placing an "A", "B", and "C", respectively, in one of the free spots of a $3 \times 3$ grid, and the first player to have three of their label in a row, column, or diagonal wins. How many possible final boards are there where the player who goes third wins the game? (Rotations and reflections are considered different boards, but the order of placement does not matter.)
