Question: A hexagonal prism has a height of 165 cm. Its two hexagonal faces are regular hexagons with sides of length 30 cm. Its other six faces are rectangles. A fly and an ant start at point \(X\) on the bottom face and travel to point \(Y\) on the top face. The fly flies directly along the shortest route through the prism. The ant crawls around the outside of the prism along a path of constant slope so that it winds around the prism exactly \(n + \frac{1}{2}\) times, for some positive integer \(n\). The distance crawled by the ant is more than 20 times the distance flown by the fly. What is the smallest possible value of \(n\)?
