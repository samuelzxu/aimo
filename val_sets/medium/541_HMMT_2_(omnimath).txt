Question: A vertex-induced subgraph is a subset of the vertices of a graph together with any edges whose endpoints are both in this subset. An undirected graph contains 10 nodes and $m$ edges, with no loops or multiple edges. What is the minimum possible value of $m$ such that this graph must contain a nonempty vertex-induced subgraph where all vertices have degree at least 5?
