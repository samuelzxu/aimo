Question: Michel starts with the string $H M M T$. An operation consists of either replacing an occurrence of $H$ with $H M$, replacing an occurrence of $M M$ with $M O M$, or replacing an occurrence of $T$ with $M T$. For example, the two strings that can be reached after one operation are $H M M M T$ and $H M O M T$. Compute the number of distinct strings Michel can obtain after exactly 10 operations.
