Problem ID: 674_HMMT_2_(omnimath)
Question: We have an $n$-gon, and each of its vertices is labeled with a number from the set $\{1, \ldots, 10\}$. We know that for any pair of distinct numbers from this set there is at least one side of the polygon whose endpoints have these two numbers. Find the smallest possible value of $n$.
