Question: Harvard has recently built a new house for its students consisting of $n$ levels, where the $k$ th level from the top can be modeled as a 1-meter-tall cylinder with radius $k$ meters. Given that the area of all the lateral surfaces (i.e. the surfaces of the external vertical walls) of the building is 35 percent of the total surface area of the building (including the bottom), compute $n$.
