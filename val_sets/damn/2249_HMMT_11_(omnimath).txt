Question: Consider sequences \(a\) of the form \(a=\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{20}\right)\) such that each term \(a_{i}\) is either 0 or 1. For each such sequence \(a\), we can produce a sequence \(b=\left(b_{1}, b_{2}, \ldots, b_{20}\right)\), where \(b_{i}= \begin{cases}a_{i}+a_{i+1} & i=1 \\ a_{i-1}+a_{i}+a_{i+1} & 1<i<20 \\ a_{i-1}+a_{i} & i=20\end{cases}\). How many sequences \(b\) are there that can be produced by more than one distinct sequence \(a\)?
