Question: Elbert and Yaiza each draw 10 cards from a 20-card deck with cards numbered $1,2,3, \ldots, 20$. Then, starting with the player with the card numbered 1, the players take turns placing down the lowest-numbered card from their hand that is greater than every card previously placed. When a player cannot place a card, they lose and the game ends. Given that Yaiza lost and 5 cards were placed in total, compute the number of ways the cards could have been initially distributed. (The order of cards in a player's hand does not matter.)
