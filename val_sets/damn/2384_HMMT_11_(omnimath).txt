Question: An apartment building consists of 20 rooms numbered $1,2, \ldots, 20$ arranged clockwise in a circle. To move from one room to another, one can either walk to the next room clockwise (i.e. from room $i$ to room $(i+1)(\bmod 20))$ or walk across the center to the opposite room (i.e. from room $i$ to room $(i+10)(\bmod 20))$. Find the number of ways to move from room 10 to room 20 without visiting the same room twice.
