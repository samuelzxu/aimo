Question: On a chessboard, a queen attacks every square it can reach by moving from its current square along a row, column, or diagonal without passing through a different square that is occupied by a chess piece. Find the number of ways in which three indistinguishable queens can be placed on an $8 \times 8$ chess board so that each queen attacks both others.
