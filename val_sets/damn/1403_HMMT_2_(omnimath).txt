Question: Diana is playing a card game against a computer. She starts with a deck consisting of a single card labeled 0.9. Each turn, Diana draws a random card from her deck, while the computer generates a card with a random real number drawn uniformly from the interval $[0,1]$. If the number on Diana's card is larger, she keeps her current card and also adds the computer's card to her deck. Otherwise, the computer takes Diana's card. After $k$ turns, Diana's deck is empty. Compute the expected value of $k$.
