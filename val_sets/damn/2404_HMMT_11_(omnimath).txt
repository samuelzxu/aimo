Question: How many ways are there to cut a 1 by 1 square into 8 congruent polygonal pieces such that all of the interior angles for each piece are either 45 or 90 degrees? Two ways are considered distinct if they require cutting the square in different locations. In particular, rotations and reflections are considered distinct.
