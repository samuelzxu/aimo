Question: In triangle $ABC$ , $AB=\sqrt{30}$ , $AC=\sqrt{6}$ , and $BC=\sqrt{15}$ . There is a point $D$ for which $\overline{AD}$ bisects $\overline{BC}$ , and $\angle ADB$ is a right angle. The ratio \[\dfrac{\text{Area}(\triangle ADB)}{\text{Area}(\triangle ABC)}\] can be written in the form $\dfrac{m}{n}$ , where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$ .
