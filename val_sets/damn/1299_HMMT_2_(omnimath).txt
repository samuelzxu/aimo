Question: An $E$-shape is a geometric figure in the two-dimensional plane consisting of three rays pointing in the same direction, along with a line segment such that the endpoints of the rays all lie on the segment, the segment is perpendicular to all three rays, both endpoints of the segment are endpoints of rays. Suppose two $E$-shapes intersect each other $N$ times in the plane for some positive integer $N$. Compute the maximum possible value of $N$.
