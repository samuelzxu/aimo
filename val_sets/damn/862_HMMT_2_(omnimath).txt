Question: Two circles $\Gamma_{1}$ and $\Gamma_{2}$ of radius 1 and 2, respectively, are centered at the origin. A particle is placed at $(2,0)$ and is shot towards $\Gamma_{1}$. When it reaches $\Gamma_{1}$, it bounces off the circumference and heads back towards $\Gamma_{2}$. The particle continues bouncing off the two circles in this fashion. If the particle is shot at an acute angle $\theta$ above the $x$-axis, it will bounce 11 times before returning to $(2,0)$ for the first time. If $\cot \theta=a-\sqrt{b}$ for positive integers $a$ and $b$, compute $100 a+b$.
