Question: For each positive digit $D$ and positive integer $k$, we use the symbol $D_{(k)}$ to represent the positive integer having exactly $k$ digits, each of which is equal to $D$. For example, $2_{(1)}=2$ and $3_{(4)}=3333$. There are $N$ quadruples $(P, Q, R, k)$ with $P, Q$ and $R$ positive digits, $k$ a positive integer with $k \leq 2018$, and $P_{(2k)}-Q_{(k)}=\left(R_{(k)}\right)^{2}$. What is the sum of the digits of $N$?
