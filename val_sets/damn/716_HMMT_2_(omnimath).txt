Question: For each prime $p$, a polynomial $P(x)$ with rational coefficients is called $p$-good if and only if there exist three integers $a, b$, and $c$ such that $0 \leq a<b<c<\frac{p}{3}$ and $p$ divides all the numerators of $P(a)$, $P(b)$, and $P(c)$, when written in simplest form. Compute the number of ordered pairs $(r, s)$ of rational numbers such that the polynomial $x^{3}+10x^{2}+rx+s$ is $p$-good for infinitely many primes $p$.
