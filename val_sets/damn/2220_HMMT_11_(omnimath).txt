Question: In the Cartesian plane, a perfectly reflective semicircular room is bounded by the upper half of the unit circle centered at $(0,0)$ and the line segment from $(-1,0)$ to $(1,0)$. David stands at the point $(-1,0)$ and shines a flashlight into the room at an angle of $46^{\circ}$ above the horizontal. How many times does the light beam reflect off the walls before coming back to David at $(-1,0)$ for the first time?
