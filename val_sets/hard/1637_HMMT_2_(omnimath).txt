Question: Let $A B C$ be a triangle with $A B=7, B C=9$, and $C A=4$. Let $D$ be the point such that $A B \| C D$ and $C A \| B D$. Let $R$ be a point within triangle $B C D$. Lines $\ell$ and $m$ going through $R$ are parallel to $C A$ and $A B$ respectively. Line $\ell$ meets $A B$ and $B C$ at $P$ and $P^{\prime}$ respectively, and $m$ meets $C A$ and $B C$ at $Q$ and $Q^{\prime}$ respectively. If $S$ denotes the largest possible sum of the areas of triangles $B P P^{\prime}, R P^{\prime} Q^{\prime}$, and $C Q Q^{\prime}$, determine the value of $S^{2}$.
