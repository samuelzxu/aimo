Question: We have a calculator with two buttons that displays an integer $x$. Pressing the first button replaces $x$ by $\left\lfloor\frac{x}{2}\right\rfloor$, and pressing the second button replaces $x$ by $4 x+1$. Initially, the calculator displays 0. How many integers less than or equal to 2014 can be achieved through a sequence of arbitrary button presses? (It is permitted for the number displayed to exceed 2014 during the sequence. Here, $\lfloor y\rfloor$ denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to the real number $y$.)
