Question: Point $P$ lies inside equilateral triangle $A B C$ so that $\angle B P C=120^{\circ}$ and $A P \sqrt{2}=B P+C P$. $\frac{A P}{A B}$ can be written as $\frac{a \sqrt{b}}{c}$, where $a, b, c$ are integers, $c$ is positive, $b$ is square-free, and $\operatorname{gcd}(a, c)=1$. Find $100 a+10 b+c$.
