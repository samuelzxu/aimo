Question: A large $5 \times 5 \times 5$ cube is formed using 125 small $1 \times 1 \times 1$ cubes. There are three central columns, each passing through the small cube at the very centre of the large cube: one from top to bottom, one from front to back, and one from left to right. All of the small cubes that make up these three columns are removed. What is the surface area of the resulting solid?
